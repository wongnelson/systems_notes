## How does CFS deal with I/O and Sleeping Processes?

CFS has a specific mechanism to handle jobs that go to sleep for long periods of time. This is particularly crucial when deciding which process to run next based on the lowest vruntime.

## What is the problem with picking the job with the lowest vruntime?

The issue arises when a job has been sleeping for a significant amount of time. Imagine there are two processes, A and B. Process A runs continuously, while process B goes to sleep for a considerable period, say 10 seconds. When process B wakes up, its vruntime will be 10 seconds behind A's. If we're not careful, B will now dominate the CPU for the next 10 seconds while it catches up, effectively causing starvation for process A.

## How does CFS handle this situation?

CFS handles this case by adjusting the vruntime of a job when it wakes up. Specifically, CFS sets the vruntime of the waking job to the minimum value found in the red-black tree. Remember, the tree only contains running (or runnable) jobs.

Here's an ASCII art representation of how vruntime adjustment might work:

```ascii
Before B wakes up:
      10 (A)
     /   
    5 (Other Jobs)

When B wakes up:
      10 (A)
     /  \
    5 (B) (Other Jobs)
```

## What is the implication of this approach?

This method allows CFS to avoid process starvation. However, it comes with a cost: jobs that sleep for short periods often do not receive their fair share of the CPU. This situation arises because these jobs frequently sleep and wake up, and each time they wake, their vruntime is set to the minimum value in the tree, thus putting them at the back of the line for CPU time. This can be an issue in systems with many short, bursty I/O-bound jobs. By setting the vruntime to the minimum value, the awakened process is given a chance to run but does not completely overtake processes with smaller vruntime values that have been running continuously.
