## How are Tickets Assigned in Lottery Scheduling?

The assignment of tickets in lottery scheduling is a critical factor since the system's behavior strongly depends on the ticket allocation. One approach is to allow users to manage tickets as they understand their jobs better. In this case, each user gets a certain number of tickets, and they can allocate these tickets to their jobs as desired. 

However, this approach doesn't provide a concrete solution to the ticket assignment problem, which remains open. This means that deciding how to distribute tickets among various jobs within a system is still a challenge that needs to be addressed.

## How is Stride Scheduling Different from Lottery Scheduling?

Stride scheduling is a deterministic scheduling algorithm introduced by Waldspurger as an alternative to lottery scheduling. This method also assigns tickets to jobs, but it computes a stride value for each job that is inversely proportional to the number of tickets it has.

The system tracks each job's progress by incrementing a pass value by the job's stride value each time the job runs. The job with the lowest pass value is selected to run next. When a job is finished, its pass counter is incremented by its stride, and the scheduler picks the next job to run based on the lowest pass value.

## How does Stride Scheduling Work?

In stride scheduling, each job is assigned a stride, computed by dividing a large number by the number of tickets that the job has been assigned. For example, if we have jobs A, B, and C, with 100, 50, and 250 tickets, respectively, we might compute the stride of each by dividing 10,000 by the number of tickets each job has. We would then get stride values of 100, 200, and 40 for A, B, and C, respectively.

Each time a job runs, a counter for it (known as its pass value) is incremented by its stride. The scheduler then uses the stride and pass to determine which job to run next. The job with the lowest pass value is picked to run, and once it's done, its pass counter is incremented by its stride.

## Why Would We Choose Lottery Scheduling Over Stride Scheduling?

Stride scheduling, while offering more precision than lottery scheduling, maintains a global state. This means that when a new job enters the system, determining its pass value can be a challenge. If it's set to 0, for instance, it will monopolize the CPU.

In contrast, lottery scheduling does not maintain a global state per process. When a new job enters the system, it simply comes with its own tickets, the total ticket count is updated, and scheduling continues. This makes it easier to incorporate new processes in a sensible manner in lottery scheduling.

## ASCII Art Example for Stride Scheduling

Consider three jobs, A, B, and C, with stride values of 100, 200, and 40, and all with pass values initially at 0. Here's a simplified ASCII diagram showing the sequence of job execution:

```ascii
Pass(A)  Pass(B)  Pass(C)  Who Runs?
0       0       0       A
100     0       0       A
100     200     0       B
100     200     40      C
100     200     80      C
100     200     120     C
200     200     120     A
200     200     160     C
200     200     200     C
200     400     200     B
200     400     240     C
```

In this sequence, C runs five times, A twice, and B once, matching their ticket values of 250, 100, and 50 respectively.

## When should you use stride scheduling

1. Real-time Systems: Stride scheduling is commonly used in real-time systems where tasks have strict timing requirements. By assigning appropriate stride values to tasks, the scheduler can ensure that each task receives its fair share of CPU time, meeting their timing constraints.

2. Multimedia Applications: In multimedia systems, different applications or processes may have varying levels of importance or priority. Stride scheduling allows assigning proportional CPU allocation to these applications based on their assigned stride values. This ensures smooth and responsive performance for critical multimedia applications while still providing resources to other tasks.

3. Resource Sharing: Stride scheduling can be useful in scenarios where multiple users or processes share system resources. By assigning stride values, fairness can be achieved, ensuring that each user or process gets a fair share of CPU time based on their relative priorities.

4. Dynamic Priority Adjustment: Stride scheduling allows for dynamic priority adjustments. By modifying the stride values of processes on the fly, the scheduler can dynamically adjust their priorities based on changing requirements or system conditions.

It's worth noting that stride scheduling is more suitable for specific use cases that require proportional CPU allocation and dynamic priority adjustments. In general-purpose systems, other scheduling algorithms like round-robin or priority scheduling may be more appropriate. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system and the tasks being executed.
