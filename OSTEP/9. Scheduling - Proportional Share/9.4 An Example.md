## What is the goal of a Lottery Scheduling System and how is it tested?

The main goal of a Lottery Scheduling System is to fairly distribute processing time among various jobs based on the number of tickets they hold. If all jobs hold an equal number of tickets and have the same run time, we expect them to complete at approximately the same time. However, due to the randomness of lottery scheduling, sometimes one job finishes before the other. To quantify the difference and evaluate the fairness of the system, we use an unfairness metric (U).

## How is the Unfairness Metric (U) defined?

The unfairness metric (U) is defined as the time the first job completes divided by the time that the second job completes. 

For example, let's say we have two jobs with run time (R) = 10. If the first job finishes at time 10 and the second job at 20, then U = 10 / 20 = 0.5. 

If both jobs finish at nearly the same time, U will be close to 1. A perfectly fair scheduler would achieve U = 1, meaning both jobs finish at exactly the same time.

## How does the job length affect the Lottery Scheduling System?

When the job length is not very long, average unfairness can be quite severe. Only as the jobs run for a significant number of time slices does the lottery scheduler approach the desired outcome of U = 1.

To illustrate this, consider a study where the average unfairness is plotted as the length of the two jobs (R) is varied from 1 to 1000 over thirty trials. The results showed that for shorter job lengths, the unfairness was quite high. But as the jobs ran for a longer number of time slices, the unfairness metric gradually approached 1, indicating a more equitable distribution of CPU time.

## What is the takeaway from the Lottery Scheduling System example?

The main takeaway from this example is that the Lottery Scheduling System, while designed to distribute CPU time equitably, may experience some degree of unfairness due to its inherent randomness, especially when job lengths are short. However, as job lengths increase, the system tends to become more fair and the unfairness metric approaches the ideal value of 1. Therefore, the Lottery Scheduling System performs best when jobs have a significant number of time slices.
