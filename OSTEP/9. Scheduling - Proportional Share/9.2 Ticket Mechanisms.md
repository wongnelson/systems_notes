## Can You Explain the Concept of Ticket Currency?

In the lottery scheduling system, the concept of 'ticket currency' is introduced. This allows a user with a set of tickets to allocate tickets among their jobs in whatever currency they like. The system then automatically converts this user-defined currency into the correct global value.

For example, let's consider two users, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A and B, each given 100 tickets. User A is running two jobs, A1 and A2, and allocates them each 500 tickets (out of 1000 total) in A’s currency.</mark> User B is running only one job and gives it 10 tickets (out of 10 total).

The system converts A1’s and A2’s allocation from 500 each in A’s currency to 50 each in the global currency. Similarly, B1’s 10 tickets are converted to 100 tickets. The lottery is then held over the global ticket currency (200 total) to determine which job runs.

```
User A                          User B
+----+ 500 A's Currency         +----+ 10 B's Currency
| A1 | ------------------\      | B1 | --------------------\
+----+                          +----+                      \
                                 /                           |
                                /                            V
+----+ 500 A's Currency        /                   Global Ticket Currency Pool
| A2 | -----------------------/                    (Total = 200 Tickets)
+----+
```

Here, the arrows (`----\` and `----/`) represent the conversion of the user's currency into the global currency. User A gives each of their processes (A1 and A2) 500 tickets each in their own currency, which gets converted to 50 each in the global currency. User B gives their process (B1) 10 tickets, which gets converted to 100 in the global currency.

This results in a total of 200 tickets in the global ticket currency pool, which are then used in the lottery to determine which process gets to run next.

When we say that A and B are each given 100 tickets, we mean that they each get a share of the CPU proportional to 100 tickets in the global currency. How they distribute this share among their jobs is entirely up to them, and they do this by creating a local currency.

In this case, User A has decided to have a local currency where they have 1000 tickets. They then distribute these 1000 tickets equally among their two jobs, A1 and A2. So each job gets 500 tickets in A's currency. Now, to convert this to global currency, we simply take the ratio of the tickets given to a job in A's currency to the total tickets in A's currency, and then multiply by A's share of the global tickets. That is,

```python
global_tickets_A1 = (tickets_A1 / total_tickets_A) * global_tickets_A
```
Substituting in the values, we get:

```python
global_tickets_A1 = (500 / 1000) * 100 = 50
```
So, in global currency, both A1 and A2 get 50 tickets each.

The situation for User B is simpler since they only have one job. They assign all their 10 tickets in B's currency to that job. So in global currency, B1 gets all 100 of B's tickets.

This system allows each user to assign their resources as they see fit in their own "currency", and the system handles the conversion back to the global currency. This allows for a more flexible and customized allocation of resources.
## What is Ticket Transfer in Lottery Scheduling?

Ticket transfer is another useful mechanism provided by lottery scheduling. A process can temporarily hand off its tickets to another process. This is especially useful in a client/server setting. 

For example, a client process sends a message to a server asking it to do some work on the client’s behalf. To speed up the work, the client can pass the tickets to the server to maximize the performance of the server while the server is handling the client’s request. When the server finishes the job, it transfers the tickets back to the client, and everything returns to its previous state.

## What is Ticket Inflation in Lottery Scheduling?

Ticket inflation is a technique where a process can temporarily raise or lower the number of tickets it owns. This can be useful in an environment where a group of processes trust one another. 

For instance, if a process knows it needs more CPU time, it can boost its ticket value as a way to reflect that need to the system, all without communicating with any other processes. However, in a competitive scenario with processes that do not trust one another, this makes little sense, as one greedy process could give itself a vast number of tickets and monopolize the machine's resources.

## Can You Show an Example of Lottery Scheduling Decision Code?

Sure, let's consider a pseudo-code example for a lottery scheduler. This pseudo-code selects a process to run based on the ticket mechanism. Here, `totaltickets` is the total number of tickets in the system, and `getrandom(0, totaltickets)` is a function that generates a random number between 0 and `totaltickets`. 

```markdown
1  // counter: used to track if we’ve found the winner yet 
2  int counter = 0;
3  
4  // winner: use some call to a random number generator to get a value, between 0 and the total # of tickets 
5  int winner = getrandom(0, totaltickets);
6  
7  // current: use this to walk through the list of jobs 
8  node_t *current = head; 
9  
10 while (current) {
11    counter = counter + current->tickets; 
12    if (counter > winner)
13        break; // found the winner 
14    current = current->next; 
15 }
16 
17 // ’current’ is the winner:

 schedule it...
```

In this code, a 'job' is represented by a node in a linked list (with each node having a `tickets` field to indicate the number of tickets it holds). The scheduler iterates over this list, summing up the tickets until the sum exceeds the `winner` value. The job that brings the sum over this value is selected to run next.
