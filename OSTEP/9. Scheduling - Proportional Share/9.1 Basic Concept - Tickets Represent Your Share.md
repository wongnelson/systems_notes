## What is the Basic Concept of Lottery Scheduling?

Lottery scheduling is based on the basic concept of tickets, which are used to represent the share of a system resource that a process should receive. The percentage of tickets a process holds equates to its share of the system resource. 

For example, consider two processes, A and B. Process A has 75 tickets while B has 25 tickets. Ideally, A should receive 75% of the CPU and B should receive the remaining 25%. Lottery scheduling achieves this probabilistically, but not deterministically, by holding a lottery at regular intervals, for instance, at every time slice.

In this lottery, the scheduler picks a winning ticket from the total number of tickets (in this example, 100). The winning ticket determines whether process A or B runs. The state of the winning process is then loaded and run.

## Can you provide an example of a Lottery Scheduler's Winning Tickets and the Resulting Schedule?

```
Lottery scheduler’s winning tickets:
63 85 70 39 76 17 29 41 36 39 10 99 68 83 63 62 43 0 49

Resulting schedule:
A A A B A A A A A A B A A A A A B B
```
As seen from the example, the use of randomness in lottery scheduling leads to a probabilistic correctness in meeting the desired proportion, but not a guarantee. Here, process B only gets to run 4 out of 20 time slices (20%), instead of the desired 25% allocation. However, over a longer duration, the two jobs are more likely to achieve their desired percentages.

## What is the Significance of Using Randomness in Lottery Scheduling?

The use of randomness in lottery scheduling offers three main advantages:

1. It avoids strange corner-case behaviors that more traditional algorithms may struggle with. For example, while the LRU replacement policy is often a good replacement algorithm, it attains worst-case performance for some cyclic-sequential workloads. Randomness, on the other hand, does not have a worst case.

2. It is lightweight and requires minimal state to track alternatives. For instance, in a traditional fair-share scheduling algorithm, tracking how much CPU each process has received necessitates per-process accounting, which needs updating after running each process. Doing so randomly requires only the most minimal per-process state (e.g., the number of tickets each process has).

3. It is quite fast. As long as generating a random number is quick, the decision-making process is also quick, making random a suitable choice where speed is required. However, the faster the need, the more random tends towards pseudo-random.

## What is the Importance of Tickets in Representing Shares in Lottery Scheduling?

Tickets are a powerful mechanism in lottery (and stride) scheduling. They are used to represent a process’s share of a CPU in these examples, but can be applied more broadly. In more recent work on virtual memory management for hypervisors, Waldspurger demonstrated how tickets can represent a guest operating system’s share of memory. Thus, if you need a mechanism to represent a proportion of ownership, this ticket concept could be the ideal solution.
