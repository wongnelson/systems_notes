## What is the basic implementation of lottery scheduling?

Lottery scheduling is surprisingly simple to implement. All it requires is a good random number generator, a data structure to keep track of all the processes in the system, and a total count of tickets. Here is a basic example of how you can implement a lottery scheduler:

### What does the basic structure of a lottery scheduling look like?

To start, we assume we keep the processes in a list. Consider a system with three processes A, B, and C, with the number of tickets assigned to them as shown below:

```
head -> Job:A Tix:100 -> Job:B Tix:50 -> Job:C Tix:250 -> NULL
```

The total number of tickets in the system is 400.

### How does the scheduling decision occur in a lottery scheduling system?

The scheduling decision begins by picking a random number (the "winner") from the total number of tickets, in this case, 400. Let's say we pick the number 300.

Next, we traverse the list with a counter used to help find the winner (you can refer to Figure 9.1 in your content). The code walks the list of processes, adding each ticket value to the counter until the value exceeds the winner. Once that happens, the current list element is the winner.

For example, if the winning ticket is 300, the process would be as follows:

1. First, the counter is incremented by 100 (A's tickets). Since 100 is less than 300, the loop continues.
2. Then the counter is updated to 150 (A's tickets + B's tickets). It's still less than 300, so the loop continues.
3. Finally, the counter is updated to 400 (A's tickets + B's tickets + C's tickets). Since 400 is greater than 300, we break out of the loop with the current pointing at C. C is the winner and gets scheduled to run.

### Does the order of processes in the list matter in lottery scheduling?

While the order of processes in the list doesn't affect the correctness of the algorithm, organizing the list in sorted order, from the highest number of tickets to the lowest, can generally make the process more efficient. This ordering ensures that in general, the fewest number of list iterations are taken, especially if there are a few processes that possess most of the tickets.

This is better explained with the below ASCII representation:

```
head -> Job:C Tix:250 -> Job:A Tix:100 -> Job:B Tix:50 -> NULL
```

In this sorted list, if the winning ticket number is high, you'll hit the winning process sooner, making the algorithm more efficient.

## How can you generate a random number in a given range?

Generating a random number in a given range can sometimes be challenging. You need to ensure that the randomness is uniform across the range. A common method to generate a random number in a range [min, max] is:

```c
int getrandom(int min, int max) {
   return min + rand() / (RAND_MAX / (max - min + 1) + 1);
}
```

This function generates a random number in the range [min, max]. For more details, you can check this [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2509679/how-to-generate-a-random-number-from-within-a-range).
