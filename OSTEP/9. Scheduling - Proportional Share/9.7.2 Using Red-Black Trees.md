## What role does efficiency play in the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)?

Efficiency is a major focus in the CFS. In the context of a scheduler, there are many dimensions to efficiency. However, one key aspect is the speed with which the scheduler can determine the next job to run. Basic data structures such as lists don't scale well, especially when systems sometimes comprise thousands of processes. This means searching through a long list every few milliseconds is inefficient.

## How does CFS achieve efficiency?

CFS addresses the issue of efficiency by maintaining processes in a data structure called a red-black tree. A red-black tree is a type of balanced tree. Unlike a simple binary tree, which can degrade to list-like performance under worst-case insertion patterns, balanced trees perform a little extra work to maintain low depths. This ensures that operations are logarithmic in time, rather than linear. This becomes especially beneficial when the number of processes, `n`, is in the thousands.

## Which processes are kept in the red-black tree?

In CFS, not all processes are kept in the red-black tree. Only running (or runnable) processes are maintained in this data structure. If a process goes to sleep (for instance, waiting for an I/O operation to complete or a network packet to arrive), it is removed from the tree and tracked elsewhere.

## Can you provide an example of how CFS uses a red-black tree?

Let's consider an example where we have ten jobs with the following `vruntime` values: 1, 5, 9, 10, 14, 18, 17, 21, 22, and 24.

If we kept these jobs in an ordered list, finding the next job to run would be straightforward: we just remove the first element. However, when placing that job back into the list (in order), we would have to scan the list to find the correct spot for insertion. This is an O(n) operation, which is inefficient for large `n`. Searching within the list also takes linear time on average.

Keeping the same values in a red-black tree, as CFS does, makes most operations more efficient. In a red-black tree, processes are ordered by `vruntime`, and most operations (such as insertion and deletion) are logarithmic in time, i.e., O(log n).

This tree represents the `vruntime` values of the processes. To choose the next process to run, CFS selects the leftmost node (the process with the smallest `vruntime`), which is an O(log n) operation. When a process's `vruntime` is updated and it needs to be reinserted into the tree, this operation is also O(log n), which is much more efficient than the O(n) operation that would be needed with a list.
