## What is the problem with direct execution?
Direct execution is quick because the program runs natively on the CPU hardware. However, when running on the CPU, there is a problem. For instance, if a process wishes to perform some kind of restricted operation, such as issuing an I/O request to a disk or gaining access to more system resources like CPU or memory. 

## How do restricted operations pose a problem?
A process needs to be able to perform I/O and other restricted operations, but without the process having complete control over the system. This poses a challenge for the operating system and hardware to work together to fulfill these requests without compromising system integrity.

## What does it mean for system calls to look like procedure calls?
System calls such as `open()` or `read()` resemble typical procedure calls in C. This can create confusion about how the system recognizes it as a system call and carries out the necessary tasks. This is because it is a procedure call, but hidden inside the call is the famous trap instruction.

For example, when you call `open()`, you are executing a procedure call into the C library. This library, for `open()` or any other system calls provided, uses an agreed-upon calling convention with the kernel to put the arguments to `open()` in well-known locations (e.g., on the stack or in specific registers). It puts the system-call number into a well-known location as well (again, onto the stack or a register), and then executes the aforementioned trap instruction.

## What happens after the trap instruction is executed?
The code in the library after the trap unpacks return values and returns control to the program that issued the system call. This is why parts of the C library that make system calls are hand-coded in assembly - they need to carefully follow convention to process arguments and return values correctly, as well as execute the hardware-specific trap instruction.

## What could happen if any process is allowed to do whatever it wants in terms of I/O and related operations?
Allowing any process to do whatever it wants in terms of I/O and other related operations would prevent the construction of many kinds of systems that are desirable. For instance, if we want to build a file system that checks permissions before granting access to a file, we can't simply let any user process issue I/Os to the disk. If we did, a process could simply read or write the entire disk, and all protections would be lost.

## What is the solution for limiting the operations a process can perform?
The solution is to introduce a new processor mode, known as user mode. Code that runs in user mode is restricted in what it can do. For example, when running in user mode, a process can't issue I/O requests; doing so would result in the processor raising an exception; the OS would then likely kill the process.

In contrast to user mode is kernel mode, which the operating system (or kernel) runs in. In this mode, code that runs can do what it likes, including privileged operations such as issuing I/O requests and executing all types of restricted instructions.

## What should a user process do when it wishes to perform some kind of privileged operation?
When a user process needs to perform a privileged operation such as reading from a disk, virtually all modern hardware provides the ability for user programs to perform a system call. Pioneered on ancient machines such as the Atlas, system calls allow the kernel to carefully expose certain key pieces of functionality to user programs, such as accessing the file system, creating and destroying processes, communicating with other processes, and allocating more memory.

## How is a system call executed?
To execute a system call, a program must execute a special trap instruction. This trap instruction transfers control from the user program to the kernel, as well as switches the machine from user mode to kernel mode. The kernel then can access system resources and perform I/O operations as required by the system call. 

## What is the role of the operating system in a system call?
The operating system, running in kernel mode, has the ability to perform restricted operations. It checks the validity of the system call and its parameters, performs the necessary operations, and finally, returns control to the user program. However, the user program does not regain the ability to perform restricted operations after the system call.

## What is the importance of system calls in managing restricted operations?
System calls provide a well-defined interface between user programs and the operating system, and they play a crucial role in managing restricted operations. They enable the operating system to maintain control over the system's resources and ensure that user programs don't misuse these resources. 

## What happens when a system call is misused or fails?
When a system call is misused or fails, an exception is raised, and control is transferred to the operating system. Depending on the severity of the failure, the operating system may terminate the program or it might return an error code to the program, indicating the problem. 

## What is the role of the hardware in enforcing restricted operations?
The hardware plays a vital role in enforcing restricted operations. It provides mechanisms to switch between user mode and kernel mode, and to transfer control from user programs to the operating system when a system call is made or an exception occurs. These mechanisms help maintain system integrity and prevent user programs from performing operations that they are not allowed to do.

## What happens when a system call is made?
When a system call is made, the processor switches to kernel mode and control is transferred to the kernel. The kernel, running in kernel mode, can perform the operations requested by the system call. After the operation is completed, control is returned to the user program, but the program continues to run in user mode, preventing it from performing restricted operations.

## How does the kernel differentiate between a system call and a regular procedure call?
The kernel differentiates between a system call and a regular procedure call based on the use of the trap instruction. When a system call is made, a trap instruction is executed, which transfers control to the kernel and switches the processor to kernel mode. This is different from a regular procedure call, which does not involve a trap instruction or a mode switch.
