### What is the problem with direct execution when switching between processes?

Direct execution is great for efficiency but it presents a problem when it comes to process switching. A process that is currently running on the CPU is doing so at the expense of the Operating System (OS) not running. If the OS isn't running, it can't initiate the switch between processes.

### Why is regaining control of the CPU a problem for the operating system?

Regaining control of the CPU is a problem for the OS because it can't perform any operations if it's not running on the CPU. This presents a practical challenge for the OS to initiate a switch between processes.

## The Cooperative Approach

### What is the cooperative approach to process switching?

In the cooperative approach, the OS trusts the processes of the system to behave reasonably. Processes that run for a long time are assumed to periodically yield the CPU so that the OS can decide to run some other task. 

### How does a process give up the CPU in a cooperative approach?

Most processes transfer control of the CPU to the OS by making system calls, for example, to open a file and subsequently read it, or to send a message to another machine, or to create a new process. Systems like this often include an explicit yield system call, which does nothing except to transfer control to the OS so it can run other processes.

### What happens when a process does something illegal in a cooperative approach?

When a process does something illegal, it generates a trap to the OS. The OS then has control of the CPU again and is likely to terminate the offending process.

## The Non-Cooperative Approach

### What is the problem with the cooperative approach?

The cooperative approach has a serious flaw. If a process ends up in an infinite loop, and never makes a system call, then the OS is powerless to regain control of the CPU. The only solution in this case is to reboot the machine.

### How does the OS regain control in a non-cooperative approach?

The OS regains control in a non-cooperative approach through a hardware feature called a timer interrupt. A timer device can be programmed to raise an interrupt every so many milliseconds; when the interrupt is raised, the currently running process is halted, and a pre-configured interrupt handler in the OS runs.

## Saving and Restoring Context

### What is a context switch?

A context switch is a low-level operation executed by the OS when it decides to switch from one process to another. It involves saving a few register values for the currently-executing process and restoring a few for the soon-to-be-executing process.

```text
Process A (running) --> Interrupt --> Save A's registers --> OS --> Decide to switch --> 
Context Switch --> Save A's registers --> Restore B's registers --> Return-from-trap --> Process B (running)
```

### How does a context switch work in xv6?

In xv6, a context switch is performed using assembly code. The context structures 'old' and 'new' are found in the old and new processâ€™s process structures, respectively.

```c
void swtch(struct context **old, struct context *new) {
  asm volatile("pushl %eax");  // pushl %eax
  asm volatile("pushl %ecx");  // pushl %ecx
  asm volatile("pushl %edx");  // pushl %edx
  asm volatile("movl %%esp,(%0)" : : "r" (old)); 
  asm volatile("movl %0,%%esp" : : "r" (new));
  asm volatile("popl %edx");  // popl %edx
  asm volatile("popl %ecx");  // popl %ecx
