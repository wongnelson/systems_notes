## What happens when an interrupt or a trap occurs during a system call?

During a system call, if an interrupt or a trap occurs, the operating system must handle it carefully to avoid inconsistencies and data loss. It is a concern in concurrent environments, where several processes or threads are running in parallel.

## How does the OS handle interrupts during interrupt processing?

One simple approach the operating system can take is to disable further interrupts during the handling of a current interrupt. This ensures that while one interrupt is being processed, no other interrupts will be delivered to the CPU.

Example:
```c
// pseudocode
interruptHandler() {
    disableInterrupts();
    // handle interrupt...
    enableInterrupts();
}
```

## What are the potential downsides of disabling interrupts?

While disabling interrupts can help ensure the integrity of the current operation, doing so for too long could lead to missed interrupts, which can be detrimental to system operations.

## What strategies do operating systems use to protect concurrent access to internal data structures?

Operating systems use a number of sophisticated locking schemes to protect concurrent access to internal data structures. This is particularly useful in multi-processor environments, where multiple activities can occur within the kernel simultaneously.

## What is limited direct execution?

Limited direct execution is a set of techniques used to implement CPU virtualization. The basic idea is to run the program directly on the CPU, but with restrictions set up by the operating system to limit what the process can do without OS intervention.

## How long does a context switch or a system call take?

The time taken for a context switch or system call has improved significantly over time, largely tracking improvements in processor performance. However, not all operating system actions follow this trend. Some operations are memory-intensive, and memory bandwidth has not seen the same dramatic improvements as processor speed. As such, upgrading to the latest processor may not necessarily result in proportional improvements in OS performance.

## How does the OS maintain control when running programs?

The OS maintains control through a protocol known as limited direct execution. The OS sets up trap handlers and an interrupt timer during boot time and runs processes in a restricted mode. This ensures that processes can run efficiently while requiring OS intervention for privileged operations or when they have used the CPU for too long.

## What is the role of the scheduler in CPU virtualization?

The scheduler decides which process to run at any given time. This decision is crucial to the efficient and fair utilization of CPU resources.

## What are the key terms related to CPU virtualization?

Here are some key terms related to CPU virtualization:
- User mode: A restricted mode of execution where typical user applications run.
- Kernel mode: A privileged, non-restricted mode where the operating system operates.
- System call: A method used by applications in user mode to request services from the operating system.
- Trap: An instruction that saves register state, changes to kernel mode, and jumps into the OS.
- Trap table: A pre-specified destination that the OS jumps into after a trap instruction.
- Timer interrupt: A hardware mechanism used by the OS to prevent a user program from running indefinitely.
- Context switch: A low-level technique used by the OS to switch from running one process to another.
  
## What does a context switch look like in code?

Here's a C function that switches the context of a CPU from one process to another:

```c
// void swtch(struct context **old, struct context *new);
// Save current register context in old and then load register context from new.
.globl swtch
swtch:
    // Save old registers
    movl 4(%esp), %eax  // put old ptr into eax
    popl 0(%eax)       

 // save the old IP
    movl %esp, 4(%eax)  // and stack
    movl %ebx, 8(%eax)  // and other registers
    // ... (other registers saved)

    // Load new registers
    movl 4(%esp), %eax  // put new ptr into eax
    movl 28(%eax), %ebp // restore other registers
    // ... (other registers loaded)
    pushl 0(%eax)       // return addr put in place
    ret                 // finally return into new ctxt
```
This code saves the current state of the process that is being switched out and then loads the saved state of the new process. The details of how this is done depends on the specifics of the CPU architecture, the operating system, and the programming language.
