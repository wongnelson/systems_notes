## What is the Basic Technique of Limited Direct Execution in an Operating System?

Limited direct execution is a technique used by operating system developers to run programs as efficiently as possible. The "direct execution" aspect involves running the program directly on the CPU.

When the OS wishes to start a program, it follows these steps:

1. **Creates a Process Entry**: This is done in a process list. It's the initialization step where an entry for the new process is created in the process list of the OS.

2. **Allocates Memory**: The OS allocates some memory for the program to use. This memory space is where the program will run.

3. **Loads Program into Memory**: The program code is loaded into the allocated memory from disk.

4. **Setup Stack with argc/argv**: The arguments that will be passed to the main function of the program (in C/C++ programs) are set up on the stack.

5. **Clear Registers**: Before the execution of the program, the CPU registers are cleared.

6. **Execute call main()**: The program starts running at the `main()` routine, or a similar entry point.

7. **Run main()**: The main function of the program is run.

8. **Execute return from main()**: Once the program finishes execution, control returns from the `main()` function.

9. **Free Memory of Process**: The memory allocated to the program is freed.

10. **Remove from Process List**: The process entry for the program is removed from the process list.
