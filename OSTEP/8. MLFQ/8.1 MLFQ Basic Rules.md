## What are the Basic Rules of Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling?

MLFQ scheduling operates based on a set of rules that determine how jobs are prioritized and scheduled for execution. In a typical MLFQ, there are multiple queues, each assigned a different priority level. A job ready to run resides in one of these queues. 

MLFQ uses two fundamental rules:

- **Rule 1:** If Job A has a higher priority than Job B, Job A is run and Job B doesn't.
- **Rule 2:** If Job A and Job B have the same priority, they are run in a round-robin fashion.

### Example:

Let's consider an example system with three queues, Q1, Q2, and Q3, where Q1 has the highest priority and Q3 has the lowest. 

Assume we have four jobs, A, B, C, and D, where A and B are in Q1, C is in Q2, and D is in Q3.

```
Q1: A, B
Q2: C
Q3: D
```

According to Rule 1, A and B, being in the highest priority queue, are scheduled for execution first. As they have the same priority (they are in the same queue), they are scheduled in a round-robin manner as per Rule 2.

## How Does MLFQ Vary Job Priorities Based on Their Behavior?

Rather than assigning fixed priorities to each job, MLFQ adjusts job priorities based on their observed behavior. This behavior-driven priority adjustment is the key to MLFQ's scheduling technique. 

If a job frequently yields the CPU while waiting for input, indicating that it might be interactive, MLFQ will maintain its high priority. However, if a job continuously utilizes the CPU for long durations, suggesting that it might be CPU-bound, MLFQ will decrease its priority. In this way, MLFQ learns about jobs as they run, using the job's history to predict its future behavior.

### Example:

Consider an interactive job A and a CPU-bound job B. Initially, both are in Q1.

```
Q1: A, B
Q2: 
Q3: 
```

Job A frequently yields the CPU for I/O operations, so MLFQ keeps it in Q1. Job B, however, keeps using its entire time quantum without yielding. Observing this, MLFQ demotes job B to Q2 in the next scheduling event.

```
Q1: A
Q2: B
Q3: 
```

Thus, MLFQ dynamically adjusts the priorities of jobs based on their observed behaviors.
