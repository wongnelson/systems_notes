## What is the Problem of Gaming in MLFQ Scheduling?

Gaming is a situation where a job manipulates its execution pattern to gain more CPU time, thus exploiting the scheduler. In MLFQ scheduling, this typically occurs due to Rules 4a and 4b, where a job can maintain its priority level by voluntarily relinquishing the CPU before its time slice ends. This manipulation might be repeated to prevent demotion to a lower priority queue.

### How Does Better Accounting Prevent Gaming in MLFQ Scheduling?

To prevent gaming, a better accounting system can be implemented within MLFQ scheduling. This involves tracking how much of a time slice a process has used at a particular priority level. Instead of forgetting the used time slice when a process gives up the CPU, the scheduler keeps track. When a process has used up its allotted time slice, it is then demoted to the next priority queue. This applies regardless of whether the time slice is consumed in one long burst or multiple smaller ones. Therefore, we can rewrite Rules 4a and 4b to a single rule:

- **Rule 4:** Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU), its priority is reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).

### Can You Provide an Example Illustrating the Gaming Problem and the Solution?

Consider a scenario with two processes, A and B. Process A is trying to game the system by relinquishing the CPU just before its time slice ends. Let's assume a time slice allotment of 10 units for simplicity.

Without better accounting (old Rules 4a and 4b), the scenario might be as follows:

```plaintext
Time:   0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100
A:     Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2  Q2
B:     Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2
```
Here, process A retains the Q2 level by giving up the CPU just before its time slice ends, thus getting an unfair share of the CPU.

With better accounting (new Rule 4), the scenario will be:

```plaintext
Time:   0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100
A:     Q2  Q2  Q1  Q1  Q0  Q0  Q0  Q0  Q0  Q0  Q0
B:     Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2  Q1  Q2
```
Here, even though process A is trying to game the system, it gets demoted after using up its time allotment at each level, thus ensuring fair CPU scheduling.
