## What are Some Issues and Considerations in Tuning MLFQ Scheduling?

When tuning Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling, several questions may arise. These include deciding the number of queues to use, the size of the time slice per queue, and the frequency at which to boost priority to prevent starvation and account for changes in process behavior. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to these questions, as the best configuration typically depends on the specific workloads and subsequent tuning.

### What is the Significance of Voo-Doo Constants (Ousterhout’s Law) in MLFQ Scheduling?

The term "voo-doo constants" was coined by systems researcher John Ousterhout to refer to specific values in systems that seem to require some form of trial and error or black magic to set correctly. These might be the parameter values that define the behavior of the scheduler, such as the number of queues, the time slice per queue, and the priority boost frequency.

Such values are often set as default parameters in a configuration file, which a seasoned administrator could adjust if something isn't working correctly. However, they're frequently left unmodified, meaning the system relies on these defaults working well in the field. This aspect is captured in Ousterhout’s Law:

### How Do Different Queues in MLFQ Vary in Time-Slice Length?

MLFQ variants often allow different time-slice lengths for different queues. High-priority queues, which typically consist of interactive jobs, are usually given shorter time slices (e.g., 10 ms or less) as it makes sense to quickly alternate between these tasks.

On the other hand, low-priority queues usually contain long-running, CPU-bound jobs, and thus longer time slices (e.g., hundreds of milliseconds) are more suitable.

Example:
Two jobs run for 20 ms at the highest queue (10-ms time slice), 
40 ms in the middle (20-ms time slice), 
and with a 40-ms time slice at the lowest.
```

### How Can an Administrator Configure the MLFQ Scheduler?

The Solaris MLFQ implementation, also known as the Time-Sharing (TS) scheduling class, provides a set of tables that determine how a process's priority is adjusted throughout its lifetime, the duration of each time slice, and how often a job's priority is boosted. An administrator can adjust these tables to influence the scheduler's behavior.

By default, the tables define 60 queues, with time-slice lengths increasing from 20 ms (highest priority) to a few hundred milliseconds (lowest), and priority boosts occurring approximately every second.

### What Different Methods Do Other MLFQ Schedulers Use?

Other MLFQ schedulers may not use a table or the exact rules described above; instead, they adjust priorities using mathematical formulas. For example, the FreeBSD scheduler (version 4.3) uses a formula to calculate a job's current priority level based on its CPU usage. This usage is decayed over time, providing a form of priority boost.

### What are Some Other Features in Many Schedulers?

Many schedulers include features such as reserving the highest priority levels for operating system work, preventing user jobs from reaching these top priority levels. Some systems also allow user input to influence priorities. For instance, the `nice` command-line utility can adjust the priority of a job, thereby influencing its chances of running at any given time.

Since the operating system doesn't always know the best approach for every process, providing interfaces for users or administrators to give hints to the OS can be beneficial. These hints, often referred to as advice, can help the OS make better decisions regarding scheduling (e.g., with `nice`), memory management (e.g., `madvise`), and file system operations (e.g., informed prefetching and caching).
