## What is Priority Boost in Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling?

Priority Boost is a mechanism introduced in MLFQ scheduling to address two significant problems - starvation and adaptability to changing job behavior. According to this rule:

- **Rule 5:** After a certain time period S, all the jobs in the system are moved to the topmost queue.

This approach ensures that CPU-bound jobs, which have been demoted to lower priority levels due to their intensive CPU utilization, get a chance to execute periodically. This rule helps to avoid starvation and ensures fair scheduling.

### Can You Provide an Example of Priority Boost in MLFQ?

Consider a system with three priority queues (Q2, Q1, Q0) and a long-running job A initially in the system. Two short-running interactive jobs B and C arrive later. Let's set the priority boost interval S to 50 ms for this example.

Without priority boost, job A will be starved once B and C arrive since they stay at the higher priority level. However, with priority boost, job A gets boosted to the highest priority every 50 ms, ensuring that it gets to run periodically.

Without Priority Boost:
Time:   0    50   100  150  200  250  300
A:     Q0->  Q0  Q0   Q0   Q0   Q0   Q0
B:           -   Q2-> Q2   Q2   Q2   Q2
C:           -   Q2-> Q2   Q2   Q2   Q2

With Priority Boost:
Time:   0    50   100  150  200  250  300
A:     Q0->  Q2  Q1   Q0   Q2   Q1   Q0
B:           -   Q2-> Q2   Q1   Q0   Q2
C:           -   Q2-> Q2   Q1   Q0   Q2
```

In the second scenario (with priority boost), even though job A doesn't get as much CPU time as B or C, it still makes progress, which wouldn't happen without priority boost.

## How to Determine the Priority Boost Interval S?

The choice of the priority boost interval S is an essential decision in MLFQ scheduling. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, and the optimal value may depend on the specific system workload and requirements. This is often referred to as a "voodoo constant," a term coined by systems researcher John Ousterhout, suggesting that setting such values often requires fine-tuning based on empirical results or heuristic methods.

- If S is set too high, long-running jobs could starve as they may have to wait for an extended period before getting boosted to a higher priority level.
- If S is set too low, interactive jobs may not get a proper share of the CPU as all jobs, including CPU-intensive ones, would be frequently boosted, making the system behave more like a round-robin scheduler.
