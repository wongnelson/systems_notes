## What is a Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduler?

The Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler is a sophisticated scheduling algorithm that addresses the problem of optimizing both turnaround time and response time without having a priori knowledge of job length. This algorithm was first introduced by Corbato et al. in 1962 in a system known as the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). 

MLFQ tries to optimize turnaround time by running shorter jobs first. However, the operating system generally doesn't know in advance how long a job will run for, which is precisely the knowledge required by algorithms like Shortest Job First (SJF) or Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF). At the same time, MLFQ tries to minimize response time to make the system feel responsive to interactive users, which is a strength of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. But Round Robin scheduling isn't ideal for optimizing turnaround time.

So, the primary challenge of the MLFQ scheduler is: given that we don't know anything about a process in advance, how can we build a scheduler to achieve the goals of minimizing both turnaround time and response time?

### Example:

Let's use an example to illustrate how MLFQ works. Suppose we have a system that uses a multi-level feedback queue with three levels, each with its own scheduling algorithm:

1. Queue 1 uses Round Robin scheduling with a time quantum of 8 milliseconds.
2. Queue 2 uses Round Robin scheduling with a time quantum of 16 milliseconds.
3. Queue 3 uses First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling.

When a new job arrives, it is placed in Queue 1. If it doesn't finish within its time quantum, it is moved to Queue 2. If it still doesn't finish within the longer time quantum in Queue 2, it is finally moved to Queue 3 and scheduled using FCFS.

By using this method, MLFQ gives priority to short and interactive jobs while still ensuring longer jobs get processed.

## How Does the MLFQ Scheduler Learn and Make Decisions?

The multi-level feedback queue is a prime example of a system that learns from the past to predict the future. This approach is common in operating systems and other areas in Computer Science, including hardware branch predictors and caching algorithms. 

The scheduler observes the behavior of jobs as they run. For instance, if a job uses all its assigned time quantum without blocking, the scheduler may consider it a CPU-bound job and demote it to a lower-priority queue. Conversely, if a job often blocks before using up its time quantum, the scheduler may classify it as an interactive job and promote it to a higher-priority queue.

This learning approach is based on the assumption that jobs have phases of behavior and are thus predictable. However, caution is needed because these techniques can easily make incorrect predictions, leading the system to make worse decisions than it would have with no knowledge at all.

### Example:

Imagine a system with two queues: Queue 1 with a quantum of 8ms, and Queue 2 with a quantum of 16ms. Jobs start in Queue 1. If a job uses up its entire quantum (suggesting it may be a long, CPU-bound job), it is moved to Queue 2 during the next scheduling event. On the other hand, if a job in Queue 2 yields before using up its entire quantum (indicating it might be more interactive), it is promoted to Queue 1. By dynamically adjusting the priority of jobs based on their observed behavior, MLFQ can adapt to the varying characteristics of the jobs it's scheduling.
