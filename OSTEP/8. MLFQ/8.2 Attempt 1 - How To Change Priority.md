## How Does MLFQ Change Job Priority Levels Over Time?

The Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) changes the priority of jobs based on their behavior to better manage a mix of interactive short-running jobs and longer-running CPU-bound jobs. Here is how MLFQ adjusts job priorities:

- **Rule 3:** When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority level (the topmost queue).
- **Rule 4a:** If a job uses up an entire time slice while running, its priority is reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).
- **Rule 4b:** If a job gives up the CPU before the time slice is up, it stays at the same priority level.

### Example 1: A Single Long-Running Job

In a system with three priority queues (Q2, Q1, Q0), let's consider a single long-running job. The job enters at the highest priority (Q2). After using up its entire time slice (e.g., 10 ms), its priority is reduced to Q1. After running at Q1 for another time slice, the job is lowered to the lowest priority (Q0), where it remains.

```
Time:   0    50    100  150  200
Queue:  Q2->  Q1->  Q0
```

### Example 2: Arrival of a Short Job

Now, let's consider two jobs: A, which is a long-running CPU-intensive job, and B, which is a short-running interactive job. Assume A has been running for some time at the lowest priority, and then B arrives. B is inserted at the highest queue (Q2) and completes in two time slices before reaching the bottom queue. Then, A resumes running at low priority. This approach allows MLFQ to approximate Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling.

```
Time:   0    50   100  150  200
A:     Q0->  Q0  Q0->  Q0->  Q0
B:           -   Q2->  Q2
```

### Example 3: Incorporating I/O Operations

For an interactive job that frequently performs I/O operations, it will often give up the CPU before its time slice is complete. In this case, MLFQ keeps it at the same priority level to not penalize the job.

Let's consider two jobs: A (long-running batch job) and B (interactive job needing CPU only for 1 ms before performing an I/O). Here, MLFQ keeps B at the highest priority because it keeps releasing the CPU, which allows it to run quickly.


```
Time:   0    50   100  150  200
A:     Q0->  Q0  Q0->  Q0->  Q0
B:           -   Q2   Q2->  Q2
```

## What Are the Potential Problems With the Basic MLFQ Scheduling Approach?

The basic MLFQ approach, while effective in many cases, has a few potential issues:

1. **Starvation:** If there are too many interactive jobs in the system, they may consume all the CPU time, preventing long-running jobs from getting any CPU time.

2. **Gaming the Scheduler:** A user could manipulate their program to trick the scheduler. For example, a job could issue an I/O operation just before the time slice ends to avoid moving down a queue and thus get a higher share of CPU time.

3. **Change in Job Behavior:** A job's nature could change over time. For instance, a CPU-bound job could become interactive.

 The basic MLFQ approach wouldn't handle this scenario well.

```
Without Priority Boost:
Time:   0    50   100  150  200
A:     Q0->  Q0  Q0->  Q0->  Q0
B:           -   Q2->  Q2

With Priority Boost:
Time:   0    50   100  150  200
A:     Q0->  Q2  Q2->  Q1->  Q0
B:           -   Q2->  Q2
```

In the first scenario, job A is starved, while in the second scenario, priority boost prevents starvation. Similarly, MLFQ needs to be designed to resist gaming and adapt to changing job behavior.
