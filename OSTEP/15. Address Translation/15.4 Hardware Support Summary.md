### Does CPU require different modes for OS and applications?

Yes, CPU should support two different modes: 

1. **Privileged (or kernel) mode**: In this mode, the operating system runs with access to the entire machine.
2. **User mode**: Applications run in this mode where their access is restricted.

A single bit, possibly stored in a processor status word, indicates the mode the CPU is currently running. On specific occasions like a system call, an exception, or an interrupt, the CPU switches modes.

### What are the base and bounds registers in the CPU?

The hardware provides base and bounds registers. Each CPU contains an additional pair of these registers as part of the memory management unit (MMU). When a user program runs, the hardware translates each address by adding the base value to the virtual address generated by the user program.

In this ASCII art, the User Program sends the virtual address to the Instruction Decoder in the CPU. The Instruction Decoder interprets the instruction and if it's a memory operation, the address is sent to the Memory Management Unit (MMU). The MMU contains the Base (b) and Bounds (l) registers. 

The MMU adds the base value 'b' to each virtual address from the user program, ensuring the address lies within the bounds 'l'. This bounds checking mechanism ensures that a program doesn't access memory locations that are outside its allocated space. 

If the address is within bounds, it is translated into a physical address which is then used to access the corresponding location in physical memory. If the address is out of bounds, a trap to the operating system is generated, which typically results in the termination of the program. 

This is a simplified representation of the process. Actual hardware might have more complex systems in place to handle memory management such as paging and segmentation, but it gives you a general idea of how base and bounds registers work.

## Why is the base register needed?

The base register, also known as the relocation register, is a key component of modern operating systems because it helps facilitate process isolation, security, and efficient memory utilization. Here's how:

1. **Process Isolation**: Each process in an operating system is given its own address space, which is a range of addresses that the process can use to reference memory. The base register stores the smallest legal physical memory address for a process. When a process tries to access memory, the operating system adds the base register's value to the virtual (relative) address to get the physical (absolute) address. This mechanism ensures that each process only accesses memory within its own address space, thus maintaining process isolation.

2. **Security**: In conjunction with a limit (or bounds) register, the base register ensures that a process cannot access memory outside its assigned range. If a process attempts to do so, the operating system can detect this illegal operation and halt the process. This protects other running processes and the operating system itself from erroneous or malicious behavior.

3. **Dynamic Relocation**: The base register facilitates dynamic relocation of processes. When a process is swapped out of memory, its entire state, including memory address space, is saved. When the process is swapped back in, it may not be loaded back into the same physical memory space it occupied previously due to memory fragmentation or other processes taking up space. In such a case, the base register can be updated to the new starting physical address, ensuring the process can continue executing as if nothing changed.

4. **Efficient Memory Utilization**: By allowing processes to be dynamically loaded and relocated in memory, the base register helps operating systems make efficient use of physical memory. Multiple processes can share the physical memory, maximizing memory utilization and system performance. 

Therefore, while the specific implementation and use of base and bounds registers can vary depending on the operating system and hardware architecture, the concept is fundamental to modern operating systems and memory management.

### How does the hardware check the validity of an address?

Hardware validates an address using the bounds register and some CPU circuitry. The hardware adds the base value to the user-generated virtual address for translation and checks whether the address falls within valid bounds.

### What special instructions should the hardware provide?

The hardware should provide special instructions to modify the base and bounds registers. This functionality allows the OS to change these registers when different processes run. However, these instructions are privileged; they can only be modified in the kernel or privileged mode.

### What could happen if a user process could change the base register?

If a user process could arbitrarily change the base register, it could wreak havoc. This unrestricted access could potentially compromise the integrity of the system's memory management and security.

### How should the CPU handle exceptions?

The CPU must be able to generate exceptions when a user program tries to access memory illegally (i.e., with an "out of bounds" address). In this case, the CPU should halt the execution of the user program and arrange for the OS's "out-of-bounds" exception handler to run. This handler can then decide how to respond, typically by terminating the process.

Similarly, if a user program attempts to change the values of the privileged base and bounds registers, the CPU should raise an exception and run the "tried to execute a privileged operation while in user mode" handler.

The CPU must also provide a method to inform it of the location of these handlers, necessitating a few more privileged instructions.
