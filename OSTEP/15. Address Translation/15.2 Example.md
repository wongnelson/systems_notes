## What are the initial assumptions made about memory virtualization?

Our initial attempts at virtualizing memory are based on the following simple assumptions:

1. The userâ€™s address space must be placed contiguously in physical memory.
2. The size of the address space is less than the size of physical memory.
3. Each address space is exactly the same size.

These assumptions might seem unrealistic, but they will be relaxed as we progress towards a realistic virtualization of memory.

## How does address translation work in a simple example?

Let's consider a simple example to understand address translation and its necessity better. Suppose there's a process with an address space as indicated in Figure 15.1. This process contains a short code sequence that loads a value from memory, increments it by three, and then stores the value back into memory. In C, it might look like this:

```c
void func() {
    int x = 3000;
    x = x + 3; // line of code we are interested in
    ...
}
```

This line of code is translated into assembly, like this:

```assembly
128: movl 0x0(%ebx), %eax ;load 0+ebx into eax
132: addl $0x03, %eax ;add 3 to eax register
135: movl %eax, 0x0(%ebx) ;store eax back to mem
```

From the process's perspective, the following memory accesses take place:

1. Fetch instruction at address 128
2. Execute this instruction (load from address 15 KB)
3. Fetch instruction at address 132
4. Execute this instruction (no memory reference)
5. Fetch the instruction at address 135
6. Execute this instruction (store to address 15 KB)

## How does the operating system manage physical memory with a single relocated process?

In the context of memory virtualization, the operating system seeks to place the process somewhere else in physical memory, not necessarily at address 0. This leads to a problem: how can we relocate this process in memory in a way that is transparent to the process? How can we provide the illusion of a virtual address space starting at 0, when in reality the address space is located at some other physical address?

![[Pasted image 20230529202141.png]]
For instance, let's assume the OS uses the first slot of physical memory for itself and relocates the process into the slot starting at physical memory address 32 KB (as shown in Figure 15.2). The other two slots (16 KB-32 KB and 48 KB-64 KB) are free. The OS needs a mechanism that can maintain the illusion of a continuous virtual memory from the process's perspective, while handling the address translation behind the scenes.
