### How does the operating system manage memory?

The operating system must manage memory allocation for new processes and reclaim memory from terminated processes. It views physical memory as an array of slots, keeping track of which are free and which are in use. When a new process is created, the OS will have to search a data structure (often called a free list) to find room for the new address space and then mark it used.

For instance, if the OS is using the first slot of physical memory for itself, and it has relocated the process into the slot starting at the physical memory address 32 KB, then the other two slots are free (16 KB-32 KB and 48 KB-64 KB); thus, the free list should consist of these two entries.

In the diagram above, the physical memory is divided into four slots. The first slot is occupied by the operating system itself, and the second slot is occupied by a process named Process A that has been allocated memory starting at the physical address of 32 KB.

The other two slots of memory are free, represented by the range of addresses in the Free List. These addresses are between 16 KB - 32 KB and 48 KB - 64 KB. The OS maintains this Free List, updating it as memory is allocated and deallocated. The Free List can be implemented in various ways such as linked lists, bitmaps, or trees. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of memory management operations like allocation and deallocation.

### What does the operating system do when a process is terminated?

When a process is terminated, whether due to graceful exit or forceful termination due to misbehavior, the OS reclaims all of its memory for use in other processes or the OS itself. It will return the process's memory to the free list and clean up any associated data structures as necessary.

### What role does the operating system play during a context switch?

During a context switch, the OS must save and restore the base-and-bounds pair, as these values differ for each running program. When the OS decides to stop running a process, it must save the values of the base and bounds registers to memory in some per-process structure like the process structure or process control block (PCB). Similarly, when the OS resumes a running process or runs it the first time, it must set the values of the base and bounds on the CPU to the correct values for this process.

### What happens when a process is stopped?

When a process is stopped, it's possible for the OS to move an address space from one location in memory to another rather easily. To move a process's address space, the OS first deschedules the process; then, the OS copies the address space from the current location to the new location; finally, the OS updates the saved base register (in the process structure) to point to the new location. When the process is resumed, its (new) base register is restored, and it begins running again, oblivious that its instructions and data are now in a completely new spot in memory.

### What is the responsibility of the OS regarding exception handling?

The OS must provide exception handlers or functions to be called when exceptions occur, which it installs at boot time using privileged instructions. For example, if a process tries to access memory outside its bounds, the CPU will raise an exception, and the OS must be prepared to react. Typically, the OS will terminate the offending process. This harsh reaction is due to the OS's protective nature of the machine it's running, and it doesn't tolerate a process trying to access memory or execute instructions that it shouldn't.
