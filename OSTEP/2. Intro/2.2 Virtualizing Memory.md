void Spin(int seconds) {
    sleep(seconds);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
    assert(p != NULL);
    
    printf("(%d) address pointed to by p: %p\n", getpid(), p);
    *p = 0;
    
    while (1) {
        Spin(1);
        //*p = *p + 1;
		*p += 1
        printf("(%d) p: %d\n", getpid(), *p);

## What is the purpose of the program depicted in Figure 2.3?

Figure 2.3 shows a simple program that illustrates the concept of memory access. Here's what the program does:

1. It allocates memory for an integer using the `malloc()` function.
2. It checks that the memory allocation was successful using an assertion.
3. It prints out the address of the allocated memory.
4. It sets the value at that memory address to 0.
5. It then enters an infinite loop. In each iteration of the loop, it waits for a second, increments the value at the memory address, and then prints it out.

This process continues indefinitely until the program is manually stopped.

## How does the program behave when multiple instances are run simultaneously?

When multiple instances of this program are run concurrently, each instance allocates memory at the same address and independently increments and prints out the value at that address. Here's what this might look like:

```sh
prompt> ./mem &; ./mem &
[1] 24113
[2] 24114
(24113) address pointed to by p: 0x200000
(24114) address pointed to by p: 0x200000
(24113) p: 1
(24114) p: 1
(24114) p: 2
(24113) p: 2
(24113) p: 3
(24114) p: 3
(24113) p: 4
(24114) p: 4
...
```

As you can see, each instance of the program is acting as though it has exclusive access to the memory at address `0x200000`.

## How does the Operating System manage to give each instance of the program its own private memory?

The Operating System is responsible for creating the illusion that each instance of the program has its own private memory, even though in reality, memory is a shared resource. It does this by implementing a feature called virtual memory.

Each instance of the program accesses its own private virtual address space, which the Operating System maps onto the actual physical memory of the machine. As far as each instance of the program is concerned, it's as though it has all the physical memory to itself.

This process of turning the shared physical memory into an array of private virtual address spaces is known as memory virtualization. It's one of the key responsibilities of an Operating System and a core topic that we'll explore throughout this course.

## What is address-space randomization and why might you want to disable it for this example?

Address-space randomization is a security technique used in Operating Systems to prevent certain types of attacks. It works by randomly arranging the positions of key data areas, making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses.

For the purpose of this example, you might want to disable address-space randomization so that each instance of the program consistently allocates memory at the same address. However, please remember to re-enable it once you're done, as it's an important security feature that helps protect your system against attacks.
