## What is Concurrency and what are its implications?

Concurrency refers to the scenario when several tasks are being executed simultaneously within the same program. This is a key concept in operating systems and modern programming in general, as it leads to many complex issues. For instance, the operating system itself is concurrently managing numerous processes, switching rapidly between them to give the illusion of simultaneous execution.

These problems of concurrency are not limited to the operating system. They also manifest in modern multi-threaded programs where multiple threads (essentially sub-programs) execute concurrently within the same memory space. This can result in inconsistent and unpredictable behaviors due to the non-atomic nature of some operations, such as updating a shared counter.

## What is the purpose of the program depicted in Figure 2.5?
## Figure 2.5

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "common.h"
#include <pthread.h>

volatile int counter = 0;
int loops;

void *worker(void *arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
        counter++;
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: threads <value>\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    loops = atoi(argv[1]);
    pthread_t p1, p2;

    printf("Initial value: %d\n", counter);

    pthread_create(&p1, NULL, worker, NULL);
    pthread_create(&p2, NULL, worker, NULL);

    pthread_join(p1, NULL);
    pthread_join(p2, NULL);

    printf("Final value: %d\n", counter);

    return 0;
}
```
The program depicted in Figure 2.5 is a simple multi-threaded program written in C. Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:

1. It defines a global counter variable and a number of loops.
2. It creates a worker function, which simply increments the counter in a loop.
3. In the main function, it creates two threads that each execute the worker function.
4. Once both threads have finished, it prints out the final value of the counter.

Here's what the output might look like with an input of 1000 for the `loops` variable:

```sh
prompt> gcc -o thread thread.c -Wall -pthread
prompt> ./thread 1000
Initial value : 0
Final value : 2000
```

In the given example with loops = 2,000, where the final value of the counter is consistently 2,000, it is likely that the first thread finishes executing before the second thread starts.

## What surprising behavior does this program exhibit when the `loops` variable is set to a higher value?

When the `loops` variable is set to a higher value, such as 100,000, the program's behavior becomes unpredictable. Here's what this might look like:

```sh
prompt> ./thread 100000
Initial value : 0
Final value : 143012 // huh??
prompt> ./thread 100000
Initial value : 0
Final value : 137298 // what the??
```

Even though each thread is supposed to increment the counter 100,000 times (for a total of 200,000 increments), the final counter value is often significantly less than 200,000 and varies between runs.

## Why does this surprising behavior occur?

This surprising behavior is a manifestation of the problems of concurrency. The counter increment operation is not atomic, which means it does not happen all at once. It consists of three distinct steps:

1. Load the value of the counter from memory into a register.
2. Increment the register.
3. Store the register value back in memory.

If these steps get interleaved between the two threads (e.g., one thread performs step 1 before the other thread has finished all three steps), they can interfere with each other, resulting in a final counter value that is less than expected. This problem is one of the main subjects we will explore in the second part of this book, in the context of building correct concurrent programs.
