## What is an Address Space in the context of operating systems?

The address space is an abstraction of physical memory created by the operating system (OS). It is the running programâ€™s view of memory in the system. This fundamental OS abstraction of memory is key to understanding how memory is virtualized.

The address space of a process contains all of the memory state of the running program, including:

1. The code of the program (the instructions).
2. The stack, which the program uses to keep track of where it is in the function call chain, to allocate local variables, and to pass parameters and return values to and from routines.
3. The heap, which is used for dynamically-allocated, user-managed memory, such as that received from a call to `malloc()` in C or `new` in an object-oriented language such as C++ or Java.

Additionally, there are other components in the address space, such as statically-initialized variables, but for simplicity, we focus on the three main components: code, stack, and heap.

## What is the placement of various components in the address space?

In a typical address space, program code lives at the top, packed into the first segment of the address space. Code is static, meaning it won't need more space as the program runs, so it can be placed at the top of the address space.

Next, the heap and stack regions may grow and shrink as the program runs. They are placed at opposite ends of the address space to allow them to grow in opposite directions. The heap starts just after the code and grows downward, while the stack starts at the bottom and grows upward.

However, this arrangement of stack and heap is conventional. When multiple threads co-exist in an address space, it is no longer feasible to divide the address space in this way.

## How does the OS virtualize memory?

The OS virtualizes memory by providing each running program with an abstraction of a private, potentially large address space, on top of a single, physical memory. This means that even though a running program believes it is loaded into memory at a particular address and has a large address space, the reality is different.

For example, when a process tries to perform a load at address 0 (a virtual address), the OS, with some hardware support, ensures the load doesn't actually go to physical address 0 but to the physical address where the process is loaded into memory.

This virtualization of memory is key to modern computer systems and allows multiple running processes to share memory without conflicting with each other.
