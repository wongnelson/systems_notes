## What is multiprogramming and how did it emerge?

Multiprogramming is a form of processing in which several programs are ready to run at a given time and the operating system switches between them. The concept emerged to increase the effective utilization of the CPU. In multiprogramming, the operating system would switch from one process to another, especially when one process performs an I/O operation. This concept came into play because machines were expensive and people began to share machines more effectively. This was particularly important when each machine cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.

## What is time sharing and why did it become important?

Time-sharing is a concept that allows multiple users to use a computer concurrently. Each user gets a small portion of the computer's time. This concept emerged after the era of multiprogramming and batch computing. Users demanded more from machines, especially programmers who were tired of long and ineffective program-debug cycles. The notion of interactivity became important as many users might be concurrently using a machine, each waiting for a timely response from their currently-executing tasks.

One way to implement time sharing is to run one process for a short while, give it full access to all memory, then stop it, save all of its state to some kind of disk (including all of physical memory), load some other process’s state, run it for a while, and thus implement some kind of crude sharing of the machine. However, this approach is slow, particularly as memory grows.

As time sharing became more popular, new demands were placed on the operating system. Specifically, allowing multiple programs to reside concurrently in memory made protection an important issue; you don’t want a process to be able to read, or worse, write some other process’s memory.

## What is the optimal approach for implementing time sharing?

The optimal approach for implementing time sharing is to leave processes in memory while switching between them, which allows the operating system to implement time sharing efficiently. For example, in a single CPU system, the OS may choose to run one of the processes (say A), while the others (B and C) sit in the ready queue waiting to run. Each of these processes has a small part of the physical memory allocated to them. This approach provides an efficient way to handle time sharing but it also raises the concern of protection among processes, as it is important to ensure that a process cannot read or write to another process's memory.
