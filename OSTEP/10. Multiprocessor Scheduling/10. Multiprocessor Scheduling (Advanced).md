## What challenges arise with multiprocessor scheduling?

When scheduling tasks on multiple CPUs, the operating system faces new challenges that were not present in single-processor scheduling. 

1. **Load Balancing:** In a multiprocessor system, it's important to evenly distribute the workload among all CPUs. If one CPU is idle while another is overloaded, the system is not being used efficiently.

2. **Synchronization:** If multiple processes or threads depend on each other, scheduling becomes more complex. The operating system has to ensure that dependencies are met, and that shared resources are accessed in a coordinated manner.

3. **Cache Coherency:** When multiple CPUs access and cache the same memory locations, keeping those cached values consistent can be challenging. The operating system needs to manage this 'cache coherency'.

## What new techniques are required for multiprocessor scheduling?

The old techniques of single-processor scheduling may not work efficiently or may require modifications to work effectively on multiple CPUs. New strategies such as 'gang scheduling', where a group of related threads are scheduled to run at the same time on different processors, or 'work stealing', where idle processors take tasks from busy ones, may be needed.

In conclusion, multiprocessor scheduling is a complex but crucial aspect of modern operating systems that aims to maximize the utilization and efficiency of multi-core systems.
