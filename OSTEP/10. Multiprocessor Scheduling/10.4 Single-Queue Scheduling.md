## What is Single-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (SQMS)?

Single-Queue Multiprocessor Scheduling (SQMS) is a straightforward approach to building a scheduler for a multiprocessor system. It involves adapting the basic framework for single-processor scheduling to a multiprocessor system by putting all jobs that need to be scheduled into a single queue. 

For instance, if there are two CPUs, it might select the two best jobs to run. This approach is easy to implement and doesn't require significant modifications to an existing scheduling policy.

## What are the shortcomings of SQMS?

SQMS has a few key limitations:

**1. Lack of Scalability:** To ensure that the scheduler operates correctly across multiple CPUs, some form of locking must be used, especially when accessing the single queue to find the next job to run. However, locks can significantly degrade performance as the number of CPUs in the system increases. As contention for a single lock grows, more system time is spent in lock overhead, reducing the amount of work the system can perform.

**2. Cache Affinity:** SQMS struggles with cache affinity. For instance, let's consider a situation where there are five jobs (A, B, C, D, E) and four processors. The queue might look like this:

```
Queue: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> NULL
```

Over time, each CPU selects the next job to run from the globally-shared queue, causing each job to bounce around from CPU to CPU. This scenario is the exact opposite of what you'd want for cache affinity. Here's an illustrative job schedule:

```
CPU 0: A -> B -> C -> D -> A ...
CPU 1: E -> A -> B -> C -> E ...
CPU 2: D -> C -> B -> A -> D ...
CPU 3: C -> B -> A -> E -> C ...
```

SQMS schedulers often include an affinity mechanism to make it more likely that a process will continue to run on the same CPU if possible. However, implementing such a scheme can be complex.

## Can SQMS achieve a better scheduling strategy that considers cache affinity?

Yes, SQMS can be adjusted to prioritize cache affinity, although it may require more complexity. Let's use the previous example with five jobs (A, B, C, D, E) and four CPUs. Consider the following job schedule:

```
CPU 0: A -> A -> A -> A -> A ...
CPU 1: E -> B -> E -> B -> E ...
CPU 2: A -> C -> A -> C -> A ...
CPU 3: A -> D -> A -> D -> A ...
```

Here, jobs A through D aren't moved across processors, with only job E migrating from CPU to CPU. This setup preserves affinity for most jobs. You might choose to migrate a different job the next time, thus achieving some sort of "affinity fairness."

However, implementing such a scheme is complicated, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of SQMS. It's simple to implement given an existing single-CPU scheduler, but it doesn't scale well due to synchronization overheads, and it doesn't readily preserve cache affinity.
