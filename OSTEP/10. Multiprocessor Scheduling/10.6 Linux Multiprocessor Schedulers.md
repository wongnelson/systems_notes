## What are the different multiprocessor schedulers used in the Linux community?

In the Linux community, there isn't a common approach to building a multiprocessor scheduler. Over time, three different schedulers have been developed: 

1. O(1) scheduler
2. Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
3. BF Scheduler (BFS)

All these schedulers have their own strengths and weaknesses. Both the O(1) and CFS schedulers use multiple queues, while BFS employs a single queue. However, there are other details that separate these schedulers.

## How does the O(1) scheduler work?

The O(1) scheduler is a priority-based scheduler, similar to the Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler discussed earlier. It adjusts a process's priority over time and then schedules those with the highest priority in order to achieve various scheduling objectives. It has a particular focus on interactivity.

## How does the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) work?

The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) uses a deterministic proportional-share approach, similar to Stride scheduling. This scheduler tries to allocate CPU resources to running tasks in a way that is fair and efficient.

## How does the BF Scheduler (BFS) work?

The BF Scheduler (BFS), which is the only single-queue approach among the three, also follows a proportional-share approach. However, it is based on a more complex scheme known as Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First (EEVDF). This algorithm selects the task with the earliest virtual deadline for execution.

Please note that understanding these modern algorithms requires a deeper dive into the specifics of each scheduler. The summary provided here is only a high-level overview. It is encouraged to read more about these schedulers to get a complete understanding of how they work.
