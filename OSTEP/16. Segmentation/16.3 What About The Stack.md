## How does the Stack fit into the segmented address space?

The stack, a crucial component of the address space, grows backwards (towards lower addresses). In physical memory, it "starts" at a higher address (for example, 28KB) and grows back to a lower address (say, 26KB). This backward growth corresponds to a range of virtual addresses, and the translation for these addresses must be handled differently. 

For this, the hardware needs some extra support. Apart from the base and bounds values, the hardware also needs to know which direction the segment grows. For instance, a bit could be set to 1 when the segment grows in the positive direction and 0 for negative. 

Here's an illustrative figure:

```ascii
Segment | Base | Size (max 4K) | Grows Positive?
--------|------|---------------|----------------
Code    | 32K  |      2K       |       1
Heap    | 34k  |      3K       |       1
Stack   | 28k  |      2K       |       0
```

## How does the hardware translate virtual addresses for the Stack segment?

Now that the hardware recognizes segments can grow in the negative direction, the translation of such virtual addresses is a bit different. Let's consider a virtual address in the Stack segment for a clearer understanding.

Suppose we want to access a virtual address 15KB, which should map to a physical address of 27KB. In binary form, our virtual address would look like this: `11 1100 0000 0000` (or hex `0x3C00`). The hardware uses the top two bits (11) to identify the Stack segment. However, the offset we are left with is 3KB. 

To determine the correct negative offset, we subtract the maximum segment size from this 3KB offset. If a segment can be a maximum of 4KB, then the correct negative offset is 3KB minus 4KB, equating to -1KB. Adding this negative offset (-1KB) to the base (28KB) gives us the accurate physical address: 27KB.

For bounds check, we ensure the absolute value of the negative offset is less or equal to the segment's current size.

## Are there special considerations for the base value of the Stack segment?

Indeed, when we say the Stack "starts" at 28KB, this value is actually the byte just below the location of the backward-growing region; the first valid byte is actually 28KB minus 1. This is different from forward-growing regions, which start at the address of the first byte of the segment. This approach makes the computation of the physical address straightforward: the physical address is just the base plus the negative offset.
