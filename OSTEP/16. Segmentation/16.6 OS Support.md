## New challenges raised by segmentation for the operating system
### What complexities does the use of segmentation introduce for the operating system?

Segmentation introduces new complexities for the operating system compared to a simpler approach with a single base/bounds pair for the entire address space.

### How does context switching relate to segmentation?

Context switching involves saving and restoring the state of a process during a switch from one process to another. When using segmentation, the segment registers, which contain information about the segmented memory, must be saved and restored correctly to ensure that each process has its own virtual address space.

### What challenges arise when dealing with segments that grow or shrink?

One challenge is managing segments that need to grow or shrink dynamically. For example, when a program requests memory allocation using a function like `malloc()`, the existing segment (e.g., heap) may have enough free space to fulfill the request. However, in some cases, the segment itself may need to expand to accommodate the allocated object. Modern memory allocators employ various techniques, such as memory mapping or system-specific APIs, to request additional memory from the operating system when needed. The operating system responds by providing more memory and updating the necessary data structures to reflect the expanded segment. However, if there is no more available physical memory or if the process has already utilized a significant amount of memory, the operating system may reject the request.

### What system call is commonly used to grow the heap segment?

The UNIX system call ~~`sbrk()`~~ mmap is often used to request additional memory and grow the heap segment when needed.

## What is the issue of managing free space in physical memory due to segmentation?

One of the main issues raised by segmentation is the management of free space in physical memory. When a new address space is created, the OS needs to find space in physical memory for its segments. Because each segment might be of a different size, the memory quickly becomes full of little holes of free space, making it difficult to allocate new segments or grow existing ones. This issue is known as external fragmentation.

For example, consider a situation where a process wishes to allocate a 20KB segment. The memory might have 24KB of free space, but not in one contiguous segment. Instead, it could be in three non-contiguous chunks, which means the OS cannot satisfy the 20KB request.

## What are some solutions to handle external fragmentation?

To tackle external fragmentation, one solution would be to compact physical memory by rearranging the existing segments. The OS could stop whichever processes are running, copy their data to one contiguous region of memory, change their segment register values to point to the new physical locations, and thus have a large free extent of memory with which to work. This process is called memory compaction.

However, compaction is expensive as it requires memory-intensive operations and uses a significant amount of processor time. Moreover, ironically, compaction makes requests to grow existing segments hard to serve, and may thus cause further rearrangement to accommodate such requests.

Another approach to managing external fragmentation could be to use a free-list management algorithm that tries to keep large extents of memory available for allocation. There are many such algorithms, such as best-fit, worst-fit, first-fit, and more complex schemes like the buddy algorithm. These algorithms aim to minimize external fragmentation, although it's important to note that no matter how smart the algorithm, external fragmentation will still exist.

## What are some examples of free-list management algorithms?

Here are some of the classic free-list management algorithms that are used to handle the issue of external fragmentation:

1. **Best-fit Algorithm**: This algorithm keeps a list of free spaces and returns the one closest in size that satisfies the desired allocation to the requester.
2. **Worst-fit Algorithm**: The worst-fit method selects the largest available free block so that the remainder will be large enough to satisfy future requests.
3. **First-fit Algorithm**: The first-fit method scans the list of free blocks and assigns the first block that is large enough to hold the object.
4. **Buddy System Algorithm**: The buddy system is a specific algorithm that divides memory into partitions to try to reduce fragmentation. The partitions are selected from a binary (i.e., powers of 2) partition tree.
