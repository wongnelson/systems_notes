## What is segmentation in the context of memory management?

Segmentation is a technique used in memory management to solve the problem of internal fragmentation. The concept involves dividing the address space into different logical segments instead of having just one base and bounds pair in the Memory Management Unit (MMU). A segment is a contiguous part of the address space with a specific length. 

Typically, we have three logically different segments in an address space: code, stack, and heap. Segmentation allows the Operating System (OS) to place each of these segments in different parts of physical memory, thereby avoiding the wastage of physical memory with unused virtual address space.

## How does the placement of segments in physical memory work?

The process involves placing each segment independently in physical memory using a base and bounds pair for each segment. For example, consider a 64KB physical memory with three segments and 16KB reserved for the OS.

As shown in the diagram, only used memory is allocated space in physical memory. This arrangement can accommodate large address spaces with large amounts of unused address space, often referred to as sparse address spaces.

## What is the hardware structure in the MMU required to support segmentation?

The MMU needs to maintain a set of base and bounds register pairs to support segmentation. For the given example, the register values would be as follows:

The figure indicates that the code segment is placed at physical address 32KB with a size of 2KB, and the heap segment is placed at 34KB with a size of 3KB. The size segment is identical to the bounds register introduced earlier. It tells the hardware exactly how many bytes are valid in this segment, thereby enabling the hardware to determine when a program has made an illegal access outside of those bounds.

## How does address translation work in segmentation?

Address translation in segmentation involves adding the base value to the offset into a particular segment to get the desired physical address. If an address is within the bounds, the hardware issues the reference to the physical memory address.

For example, if a reference is made to virtual address 100, which is in the code segment, the hardware will add the base value (32KB) to the offset into this segment (100 in this case) to arrive at the desired physical address: 100 + 32KB, or 32868. If the address is within bounds (100 is less than 2KB), the hardware will issue the reference to physical memory address 32868.

## What happens in the case of an illegal address?

If an illegal address is referenced, i.e., a virtual address that is beyond the end of a segment, the hardware detects that the address is out of bounds. It traps into the OS, which is likely to lead to the termination of the offending process. This error is known as a segmentation violation or segmentation fault, a term familiar to many programmers.
