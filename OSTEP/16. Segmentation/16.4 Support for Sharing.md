## How segmentation support sharing
### What efficiencies can be achieved with additional hardware support in the evolution of segmentation?

The additional hardware support in the evolution of segmentation allows for new efficiencies, particularly in memory sharing between different address spaces. By sharing memory segments, system designers can save memory and improve resource utilization.

### How does hardware support enable memory sharing in segmentation?

To support memory sharing, hardware provides additional support in the form of protection bits. These protection bits are associated with each memory segment and indicate whether a program can read, write, or execute the code within the segment.

### How does setting a code segment to read-only enable code sharing?

Setting a code segment to read-only allows the same code to be shared across multiple processes without compromising isolation. Each process perceives that it is accessing its private memory, while the operating system (OS) is actually sharing the memory. By making the code segment read-only, the OS ensures that the process cannot modify the shared memory, maintaining the illusion of private memory for each process.

Here's an illustrative figure for this:

## How do protection bits modify the hardware algorithm?

With the addition of protection bits, the hardware algorithm we described earlier would need modifications. Besides checking whether a virtual address is within bounds, the hardware also has to verify whether a particular access is permissible.

If a user process attempts to write to a read-only segment or execute from a non-executable segment, the hardware should raise an exception. This alerts the OS to the offending process, allowing it to manage the situation appropriately.
