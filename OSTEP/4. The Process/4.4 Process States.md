## What Are the Key Data Structures Used by an Operating System?

The OS, like any program, has some key data structures that track various pieces of information. The main data structures used by an OS include:

1. **Process List**: To track the state of each process, the OS will keep some kind of process list for all processes that are ready and additional information to track which process is currently running.

2. **Blocked Processes Tracker**: The OS must also track blocked processes; when an I/O event completes, the OS should make sure to wake the correct process and ready it to run again.

Let's consider the xv6 kernel, which requires the OS to track specific information about each process. This is defined in the `struct proc` as follows:

```c
// the registers xv6 will save and restore
// to stop and subsequently restart a process
struct context {
  int eip;
  int esp;
  int ebx;
  int ecx;
  int edx;
  int esi;
  int edi;
  int ebp;
};

// the different states a process can be in
enum proc_state { UNUSED, EMBRYO, SLEEPING,
                  RUNNABLE, RUNNING, ZOMBIE };

// the information xv6 tracks about each process
// including its register context and state
struct proc {
  char *mem;              // Start of process memory
  uint sz;                // Size of process memory
  char *kstack;           // Bottom of kernel stack for this process
  enum proc_state state;  // Process state
  int pid;                // Process ID
  struct proc *parent;    // Parent process
  void *chan;             // If !zero, sleeping on chan
  int killed;             // If !zero, has been killed
  struct file *ofile[NOFILE]; // Open files
  struct inode *cwd;          // Current directory
  struct context context; // Switch here to run process
  struct trapframe *tf;   // Trap frame for the current interrupt
};
```
Similar process structures exist in real-world operating systems such as Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.

## What is a Context Switch in an Operating System?

A context switch is a technique used by the OS to stop and restart a process. When a process is stopped, its registers will be saved to a memory location (in the `context` struct for xv6). By restoring these registers, i.e., placing their values back into the actual physical registers, the OS can resume running the process. This is a fundamental mechanism in multitasking operating systems to switch between different running processes.

## What are Some Additional States a Process Can Be In?

Apart from running, ready, and blocked, a process can be in a few other states:

1. **Unused**: This is the initial state that the process is in when it is being created.

2. **Embryo**: The process is in the creation stage but is not ready to run yet.

3. **Sleeping**: The process is waiting for a specific event to complete or a resource to become available.

4. **Zombie**: This is the final state where a process has exited but has not yet been cleaned up. This state allows other processes (usually the parent that created the process) to examine the return code of the process to see if the just-finished process executed successfully. Once finished, the parent will make a final call (e.g., wait()) to wait for the completion of the child and to also indicate to the OS that it can clean up any relevant data structures that referred to the now-extinct process.

## What is a Process Control Block (PCB)?

The Process Control Block (PCB), also referred to as a process descriptor, is a data structure in the operating system kernel containing the information needed to manage a particular process. The PCB is the manifestation of a process in an operating system. It contains details about the process state, program counter, CPU registers, scheduling information, memory management information, etc.

A PCB could look something like this in C:

```c
struct PCB {
    int id;
    enum proc_state state;
    int priority;
    struct context context;
    // ...other necessary fields...
};
```

This PCB will contain all necessary information to manage and schedule the process in the operating system.
