## What are some common mechanisms used in most allocators?

Before diving into the specifics of memory allocation policy, it's crucial to understand a few common mechanisms that most allocators employ. These include splitting and coalescing, tracking the size of allocated regions, and building a simple list within the free space to keep track of what is free and what isn't.

## What are splitting and coalescing in the context of memory allocation?

### Splitting

Splitting is a common technique in memory allocators. It's used when a memory request is smaller than the size of any particular free chunk.

A free list contains a set of elements that describe the remaining free space in the heap. Imagine we have a 30-byte heap, with two free chunks of 10 bytes each at addresses 0 and 20 (the rest of the space is occupied).

```ascii
0 10 20 30
[FREE|USED|FREE]
```

If a request for 1 byte is made, the allocator performs splitting. It finds a free chunk of memory that can satisfy the request and splits it into two. The first chunk is returned to the caller; the second chunk remains on the list.

Let's assume the allocator decided to use the second of the two elements on the list to satisfy the request. The call to `malloc()` would return 20 (the address of the 1-byte allocated region) and the list would now look like this:

```ascii
head -> addr: 0, len: 10 -> addr: 21, len: 9 -> NULL
```

### Coalescing

Coalescing is another mechanism found in many allocators, serving as the complement to splitting. It's used when a chunk of memory is freed.

Taking the example from above again, what happens when an application calls `free()` on the 10-byte chunk in the middle of the heap? If we simply add this free space back into our list without too much consideration, we might end up with a list that makes it seem like the heap is divided into three chunks of 10 bytes each.

To avoid this problem, allocators coalesce free space when a chunk of memory is freed. The allocator checks the addresses of the chunk being returned and the nearby chunks of free space; if the newly-freed space sits adjacent to one or more existing free chunks, it merges them into a single larger free chunk. Thus, with coalescing, our final list should look like this:

```ascii
head -> addr: 0, len: 30 -> NULL
```

With coalescing, an allocator can better ensure that large free extents are available for the application.

## How is the size of allocated regions tracked in memory allocation?

In most allocators, headers are used to keep track of the size of allocated regions. Each allocated block of memory includes a header that contains metadata about the block.

Figure 17.1 and 17.2 illustrate this concept. Figure 17.1 shows an allocated region with a header and the returned bytes to the caller.

```ascii
|  Header  | The 20 bytes returned to caller |
(hptr)      (ptr)
```

Figure 17.2 further elaborates on the specific contents of the header, which typically include the size of the allocated block and possibly other metadata. In this case, it includes a magic number, which can be used to detect memory corruption.

```ascii
| size: 20 | magic: 1234567 | The 20 bytes returned to caller |
```

In the given example, the size of the allocated block is 20 bytes, and the magic number is 1234567. The remaining 20 bytes are returned to the caller.
