## How is a free list embedded in the memory allocation process?

A free list, which describes free chunks of memory in the heap, is built within the free space itself, rather than being a conceptual entity. 

### How is a free list initialized?

To manage memory as a free list, it needs to be initialized. For instance, if you have a 4096-byte chunk of memory (i.e., a 4KB heap), the free list should start with a single entry of size 4096 (minus the header size).

Consider the following struct which describes a node of the free list in C:

```c
typedef struct __node_t {
    int size;
    struct __node_t *next;
} node_t;
```

Here's an example of how the heap can be initialized with the first element of the free list:

```c
// mmap() returns a pointer to a chunk of free space
node_t *head = mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
//By subtracting `sizeof(node_t)` from the total chunk size, we can determine the available free space within this chunk.
head->size = 4096 - sizeof(node_t);
head->next = NULL;
```

### How is memory allocated from a free list?

When a chunk of memory is requested, the memory allocation library will find a chunk that can accommodate the request. If a chunk is found, it's split into two: one chunk sufficient for the request (including the header), and the remaining free chunk.

Let's consider an example where a chunk of 100 bytes is requested. If the only available chunk is 4088 bytes, it's split into a 108-byte chunk (100 bytes for the user, 8 bytes for the header), and the remaining 3980 bytes remain in the free list.

When three chunks of 100 bytes each are allocated, the first 324 bytes of the heap are used (108 bytes per allocation), and the remaining 3764 bytes are still available.

### How are chunks of memory returned to the free list?

When the calling program returns memory via `free()`, the library figures out the size of the free region, and then adds the free chunk back onto the free list. 

However, simply adding the free chunk to the list can result in fragmentation of the free list. In the given scenario, even though all the memory is free, it appears fragmented as it's divided into separate chunks.

### How can fragmentation of the free list be avoided?

Fragmentation can be avoided by coalescing the list, which involves going through the list and merging neighboring chunks. After coalescing, the heap will appear as a single free chunk instead of multiple fragmented chunks.
