## What is the Worst Fit strategy in memory allocation?

The Worst Fit strategy in memory allocation is a method that aims to reduce fragmentation of memory chunks by selecting the largest available chunk from the free list for allocation.

### How does the Worst Fit strategy choose a chunk from the free list?

The Worst Fit strategy picks the largest chunk from the free list. From this selected chunk, it allocates the memory as requested and leaves the remaining (large) chunk on the free list. 

Here's a simple code illustration for this strategy:

```c
node_t *worst_fit(node_t *head, int requested_size) {
    node_t *current = head;
    node_t *worst_fit_chunk = NULL;

    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->size >= requested_size) {
            if (worst_fit_chunk == NULL || current->size > worst_fit_chunk->size) {
                worst_fit_chunk = current;
            }
        }
        current = current->next;
    }

    return worst_fit_chunk;
}
```

In this code, the function `worst_fit` takes the head of the free list and the requested size as parameters. It traverses the free list searching for chunks that are larger than or equal to the requested size. Among these, it keeps the largest one found, which is considered the worst fit.

### What is the intuition behind the Worst Fit strategy?

The intuition behind the Worst Fit strategy is to leave large chunks free, instead of many small chunks which could be a result of the Best Fit strategy. The thinking is to avoid fragmentation and make larger chunks of memory available for future requests that may need larger memory spaces.

### What are the drawbacks of the Worst Fit strategy?

Though the Worst Fit strategy aims to prevent fragmentation by leaving large chunks free, in practice, it may not perform as well as expected. Firstly, a full search of free space is required which can be costly in terms of performance. Moreover, studies have shown that this approach may lead to excess fragmentation over time, while still incurring high overheads. In many cases, it results in inefficient use of memory with significant space left unutilized. Therefore, it's not commonly used in practice.
