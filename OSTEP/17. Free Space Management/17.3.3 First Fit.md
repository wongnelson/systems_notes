[[9.9.7.1 First fit]]
## What is the First Fit strategy in memory allocation?

The First Fit strategy is a memory allocation method that quickly finds and allocates the first block of memory that is large enough to satisfy the request.

### How does the First Fit strategy operate?

The First Fit strategy starts scanning the free list from the beginning, and as soon as it finds a block of memory that is big enough to accommodate the requested size, it allocates this block to the request. The remaining free space, if any, in the allocated block is kept free for future allocations.

Here is a simple code example illustrating the First Fit strategy:

```c
node_t *first_fit(node_t *head, int requested_size) {
    node_t *current = head;

    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->size >= requested_size) {
            return current;
        }
        current = current->next;
    }

    return NULL;
}
```

In this function, `first_fit` takes the head of the free list and the requested size as parameters. It traverses the free list and returns the first chunk that is large enough to satisfy the request.

### What is the advantage of the First Fit strategy?

The significant advantage of the First Fit strategy is its speed. Unlike strategies such as Best Fit and Worst Fit, which require exhaustive searches of the free list, First Fit can complete as soon as it finds a suitable block. This reduced search time can lead to performance benefits.

### What are the challenges in implementing the First Fit strategy?

Despite its speed, the First Fit strategy can potentially lead to inefficient memory usage. It may leave many small, unusable memory blocks (known as fragmentation) at the beginning of the free list. The allocator's management of the free list's order becomes critical to mitigate this issue.

One common solution is address-based ordering. In this approach, the allocator keeps the free list ordered by the memory address of each free block. This arrangement simplifies the process of coalescing adjacent free blocks, which can reduce fragmentation.
