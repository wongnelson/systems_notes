[[9.9.7.3 Best fit]]
## What is the Best Fit strategy in memory allocation?

The Best Fit strategy in memory allocation is a method that aims to reduce waste when assigning memory chunks. This strategy works by searching through the free list of memory chunks and identifying those that are equal to or larger than the requested size.

### How does the Best Fit strategy choose a chunk from the free list?

The Best Fit strategy picks the smallest chunk from the group of identified candidates. This chosen chunk is known as the "best-fit" chunk. It could also be termed the "smallest fit" chunk.

The strategy only requires one pass through the free list to find the correct block to return. Here's a simplified code illustration of this:

```c
node_t *best_fit(node_t *head, int requested_size) {
    node_t *current = head;
    node_t *best_fit_chunk = NULL;

    while (current != NULL) {
        if (current->size >= requested_size) {
            if (best_fit_chunk == NULL || current->size < best_fit_chunk->size) {
                best_fit_chunk = current;
            }
        }
        current = current->next;
    }

    return best_fit_chunk;
}
```

In the above code, the function `best_fit` receives the head of the free list and the requested size as parameters. It iterates through the free list looking for chunks that are larger than or equal to the requested size. Among those, it keeps track of the smallest one found, which is considered the best fit.

### What is the downside of the Best Fit strategy?

While the Best Fit strategy can be effective at reducing wasted space, it can come at a cost in terms of performance. Naive implementations can suffer a significant performance penalty when performing an exhaustive search for the appropriate free block. To mitigate this, data structures like binary search trees, balanced trees, or heaps can be used to store the free list, enabling faster searches for the best-fit chunk.
