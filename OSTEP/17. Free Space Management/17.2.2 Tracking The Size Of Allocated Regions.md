## How is the size of allocated regions tracked in memory allocation?

In most memory allocators, the size of allocated regions is tracked using headers. These headers are small blocks of information stored in memory, usually right before the chunk of memory handed out to the application.

### How is the header structured in memory allocation?

The header contains at least the size of the allocated region and may also contain additional pointers to speed up deallocation, a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">magic number </mark>for integrity checking, and other information.

Consider this simple struct for a header in C, which contains the size of the region and a magic number:

```c
typedef struct {
    int size;
    int magic;
} header_t;
```

Let's use this header in the context of an allocated block of size 20 bytes:

```ascii
| size: 20 | magic: 1234567 | The 20 bytes returned to caller |
```

The user might call `malloc()` to allocate this memory, storing the result in a pointer:

```c
ptr = malloc(20);
```

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>
In computing, a "magic number" is a constant numerical or text value used to identify a file format or protocol. These "magic numbers" are typically found in the headers of files and are used by the operating system to recognize the format of the file and the type of data it contains.

The term "magic number" or "magic constant" comes from the traditional computing jargon, where it referred to specific recognized values that have unique properties.

In the context of file formats, the "magic number" is placed in the file's header, which is at the very beginning of the file. These numbers are then used by file utilities and operating systems to quickly identify the file type without having to look through the entire file.

For example, a JPEG file, a common format for images, always starts with a hexadecimal value of 'FF D8' and ends with 'FF D9'. When an operating system or a program reads a file and finds these values at the beginning and end, it can quickly identify the file as a JPEG image.

Here's a more practical example:

If you're using a Unix-based operating system, there's a utility called `file` that can determine the type of file based on its magic number. You can run the `file` command followed by a filename to see the file's type. For example:

```bash
$ file myimage.jpg
myimage.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
```

Here, `file` reads the magic number from the beginning of `myimage.jpg` and uses it to determine that it's a JPEG image file.

It's important to note that while magic numbers are very useful for quick file type identification, they also have downsides. Primarily, if a file's magic number is changed or corrupted, it can be incorrectly identified or not recognized at all. Additionally, relying too heavily on magic numbers can lead to brittle code, as the format can change in newer versions of the file type or protocol.

### How does the allocator identify the header when the user frees memory?

The interface to `free(void *ptr)` does not take a size parameter; thus, it is assumed that given a pointer, the malloc library can quickly determine the size of the region of memory being freed.

When the user calls `free(ptr)`, the library uses simple pointer arithmetic to determine where the header begins:

```c
void free(void *ptr) {
    header_t *hptr = (header_t *) ptr - 1;
    ...
}
```

Once the library has a pointer to the header, it can easily verify whether the magic number matches the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">expected value </mark>as a sanity check (for example, `assert(hptr->magic == 1234567)`), and calculate the total size of the newly-freed region by adding the size of the header to the size of the region.The interface to `free(void *ptr)` does not take a size parameter; thus, it is assumed that given a pointer, the malloc library can quickly determine the size of the region of memory being freed.

## Where does the expected value come from?
The expected value of the magic number is typically defined within the implementation of the memory management library itself. It is a predefined value chosen by the library developer as a known and fixed value that the magic number should be.

The purpose of the expected value is to have a reference value that the library can compare against the actual magic number stored in the header. If the two values match, it indicates that the memory block is likely intact and hasn't been corrupted.

The specific choice of the expected value is generally arbitrary, as long as it is unique or distinct and unlikely to occur naturally within the data being managed. It could be any constant or predetermined value that the library defines.

For example, in the code snippet you provided, the library could define the expected magic number value as `1234567`. This value is arbitrary but serves as a marker that the library can check against when verifying the integrity of the memory block.

It's important to note that the magic number alone is not a foolproof security measure or a comprehensive error detection mechanism. It is a simple check that can provide a basic level of assurance and help identify potential issues with memory corruption. More robust memory management systems may employ additional techniques and checks for enhanced reliability and security.

### How does the allocator consider the header size when allocating memory?

When a user requests `N` bytes of memory, the library doesn't search for a free chunk of size `N`. Instead, it searches for a free chunk of size `N` plus the size of the header. This consideration is crucial because the header must also be stored with the allocated region. This is an important detail that impacts the way memory allocators work.
