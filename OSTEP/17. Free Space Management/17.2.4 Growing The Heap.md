### What do most traditional allocators do when the heap runs out of space?

Most traditional allocators start with a small-sized heap and request more memory from the Operating System (OS) when they run out. This usually involves making a system call (for instance, `sbrk` in most UNIX systems) to expand the heap.

### How does the `sbrk` system call work to expand the heap?

The `sbrk` system call works by extending the heap of a process. When the `sbrk` function is called, it finds free physical pages in the system's memory. The operating system then maps these free pages into the address space of the requesting process, effectively expanding the heap. The `sbrk` function returns the value of the end of the new heap, allowing the process to access the additional memory. This enables the successful servicing of memory allocation requests for a larger heap size.

Here is a simple illustration:

```c
// Let's assume that the heap is currently full
void *end_of_heap = sbrk(0);  // This gets the current end of the heap

// Request more space for the heap
void *new_space = sbrk(size_to_expand);

if (new_space == (void*) -1) {
    // The sbrk failed, handle the error (e.g., by returning NULL to the caller)
} else {
    // The sbrk succeeded, the heap is now bigger by 'size_to_expand' bytes
    // 'new_space' points to the start of the newly allocated space
}
```

In this code snippet, `sbrk(0)` is used to find the current end of the heap. Then `sbrk(size_to_expand)` is used to request for the heap to be expanded by `size_to_expand` bytes. If `sbrk` is successful, it will return a pointer to the start of the newly allocated space. If it fails, it will return `(void*) -1`, at which point you can handle the error as needed.
