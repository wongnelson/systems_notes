[[9.9.7.2 Next fit]]
## What is the Next Fit strategy in memory allocation?

Next Fit is a variation of the First Fit memory allocation strategy. Instead of always beginning the search for a free block at the start of the list, Next Fit remembers the last location it searched and resumes from there the next time it is called to allocate memory.

### How does the Next Fit strategy operate?

The Next Fit strategy maintains an extra pointer to the location within the free list where it last performed a search. When a new memory allocation request comes in, it starts the search from this saved location instead of the beginning of the list. If it finds a block that is large enough to accommodate the requested size, it allocates this block to the request. The remaining free space, if any, in the allocated block is kept free for future allocations.

Here is a simple code example illustrating the Next Fit strategy:

```c
node_t *next_fit(node_t *head, int requested_size) {
    static node_t *current = NULL;
    
    if (current == NULL)
        current = head;
    
    node_t *start = current;
    
    do {
        if (current->size >= requested_size) {
            return current;
        }
        current = current->next;
        if (current == NULL)
            current = head;
    } while (current != start);
    
    return NULL;
}
```

In this function, `next_fit` takes the head of the free list and the requested size as parameters. It maintains a static pointer `current` that retains its value across function calls. It traverses the free list and returns the first chunk that is large enough to satisfy the request.

### What is the advantage of the Next Fit strategy?

The key advantage of the Next Fit strategy is that it attempts to spread the searches for free space throughout the list more uniformly. This approach can help prevent fragmentation at the beginning of the list, which can occur with the First Fit strategy.

### How does the performance of Next Fit compare to First Fit?

The performance of the Next Fit strategy is quite similar to that of the First Fit. Like First Fit, Next Fit avoids the need for an exhaustive search through the free list, which can result in significant time savings. However, the performance may vary depending on the specific memory allocation and deallocation patterns of the program.
