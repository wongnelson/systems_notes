## What is a Scheduling Metric?

A scheduling metric is something that we use to measure different aspects of scheduling in a system. This allows us to compare the performance and outcomes of different scheduling policies. While there are various metrics that could be considered, for simplicity, we will focus on a single metric in this context: the turnaround time.

## What is the Turnaround Time in a Scheduling Context?

The turnaround time of a job is the time at which the job completes minus the time at which the job arrived in the system. This can be formally defined as:

```plaintext
Tturnaround = Tcompletion − Tarrival 
```

For the sake of simplicity, we are assuming that all jobs arrive at the same time, so Tarrival = 0 and hence Tturnaround = Tcompletion. 

**For example**, if a job completes at time 10 (Tcompletion = 10) and it arrived at time 0 (Tarrival = 0), the turnaround time (Tturnaround) would be 10 - 0 = 10.

This definition of turnaround time will change as we consider more complex scheduling scenarios where jobs do not all arrive at the same time.

## What Other Metrics are of Interest in Scheduling?

While performance is a primary focus, another important metric in scheduling is fairness. One commonly used measure of fairness is Jain’s Fairness Index. 

## How Do Performance and Fairness Interact in Scheduling?

Performance and fairness can often be in conflict when it comes to scheduling. A scheduler might be able to optimize performance, but this could be at the expense of fairness. For example, a scheduler might prioritize certain jobs, leading to excellent turnaround times for those jobs (high performance) but leaving other jobs waiting for a long time (low fairness).

This illustrates a fundamental tension in scheduling: achieving the best performance might mean making trade-offs with fairness. This shows that achieving the perfect balance in scheduling can be a challenging task.
