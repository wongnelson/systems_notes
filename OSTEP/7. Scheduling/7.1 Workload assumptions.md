## What are Workload Assumptions in Scheduling Policies?

Workload assumptions refer to the predetermined conditions or attributes of the processes, often called jobs, running in a system. These assumptions are significant as they provide a foundation for developing scheduling policies. The more precise and accurate the assumptions about the workload, the more fine-tuned the scheduling policy can be.

For example, if you assume that all jobs arriving in the system will require the same amount of CPU time, your scheduling policy could be as simple as a First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) approach. However, if jobs have varying requirements, your scheduling policy may need to account for this variety, possibly prioritizing shorter jobs or jobs with impending deadlines.

It's important to note that initial workload assumptions are often simplified and may not entirely reflect real-life conditions. However, they provide a good starting point, which can be continuously refined and adjusted as more information about the workload becomes available.

## What are the Typical Simplifying Assumptions Made About the Workload?

To make our initial model of the system more manageable, we often start with several simplifying assumptions. These are:

1. **Each job runs for the same amount of time.** This means we're assuming all jobs are equal in terms of their CPU requirements. In reality, jobs often vary in the amount of processing time they need.
    
2. **All jobs arrive at the same time.** This assumption means we're not considering the arrival times of the jobs. In real-life scenarios, jobs typically arrive in the system at different times.
    
3. **Once started, each job runs to completion.** Here, we're assuming there are no interruptions to a job once it has started running. In reality, jobs may be preempted or interrupted for a variety of reasons.
    
4. **All jobs only use the CPU (i.e., they perform no I/O)** This means we're only considering compute-bound jobs and ignoring I/O-bound jobs that might spend a significant amount of time waiting for I/O operations to complete.
    
5. **The run-time of each job is known.** This assumption implies that we have perfect knowledge of the execution time for each job, which is unlikely in a real-world scenario.
    

Let's illustrate this with a simple example.

Let's assume we have three jobs, `Job A`, `Job B`, and `Job C`, each requiring 5 units of time. These jobs arrive at the system at the same time, and once they start, they will run to completion. They are only using the CPU and not performing any I/O operations. The run-time for each of these jobs is known to be 5 units of time.

Under these assumptions, a simple scheduling policy like Round Robin, where each job gets an equal share of CPU time in a cyclic order, would work perfectly fine. However, if these jobs had different execution times or if they arrived at different times, a more sophisticated scheduling policy might be required.

## Which Assumptions are More Unrealistic Than Others?

Some of these assumptions are indeed unrealistic when compared to real-world scenarios. In particular, the assumption that the run-time of each job is known ahead of time is particularly unrealistic.

This assumption implies that the scheduler has perfect knowledge about how long each job will run, which is not typically the case in real-world systems. For example, consider a job that reads in user input, processes it in some way, and then prints out a result. The runtime of this job is heavily dependent on the input it receives, which is not known ahead of time.

Therefore, while these assumptions provide a good starting point for understanding scheduling policies, keep in mind that they are simplifications and the real-world is often more complex and unpredictable
