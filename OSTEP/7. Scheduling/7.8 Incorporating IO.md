## How does a Scheduler Incorporate I/O Operations?

Schedulers must take into account I/O operations when allocating CPU time to jobs. When a job initiates an I/O request, it enters a blocked state, waiting for the I/O operation to complete. As the job isn't utilizing the CPU during this period, the scheduler can allocate CPU time to another job.

```plaintext
Example:
Job A: Runs for 10 ms, then issues an I/O request.
Job B: Utilizes CPU for 50 ms with no I/O.

Schedule without considering I/O:

CPU Disk
0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Time
A                            B
```
In this example, resources are poorly utilized, as no overlap exists between CPU usage and I/O operations.

## How can a Scheduler Optimize CPU Utilization Considering I/O Operations?

Schedulers can optimize CPU utilization by treating each CPU burst as a separate job. For example, in a Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF) scheduler, if a job is broken into multiple sub-jobs due to I/O operations, each sub-job is treated as a separate entity. This allows the scheduler to run another job during the I/O wait time, thus achieving overlap between CPU usage and I/O operations.

```plaintext
Example:
Job A: Runs for 10 ms, then issues an I/O request.
Job B: Utilizes CPU for 50 ms with no I/O.

Schedule considering I/O:

CPU Disk
0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Time
A B A B A B A B A B
```
In this example, Job A's sub-jobs and Job B run concurrently, leading to better utilization of system resources.

## How does Incorporating I/O Impact System Performance?

Incorporating I/O operations into scheduling decisions can significantly improve system performance by ensuring more efficient CPU utilization. "Interactive" processes that frequently perform I/O operations get run more regularly, thereby reducing their response times. While these interactive jobs are waiting for I/O completion, CPU-intensive jobs can run, improving overall system efficiency.
