Note: This post only touches on code motion, but the book covers more

Code motion is a compiler optimization technique that involves moving invariant computations out of loops or other repetitive code sections and placing them outside, so that they are only computed once rather than repeatedly.

A simple example of code motion optimization would be the following:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int x = 2 * i;
    int y = x + 1;
    array[i] = y;
}
```
In this code snippet, the expressions `2 * i` and `x + 1` are computed repeatedly for each iteration of the loop. However, these expressions are actually invariant, since they don't depend on the loop variable.Thereforewe can optimize this code by moving the declaration of `x` and `y` outside of the loop", rather than the computations of `x` and `y`

```c
int x;
int y;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    x = 2 * i;
    y = x + 1;
    array[i] = y;
}
```
By doing this, we avoid computing `x` and `y` repeatedly for each iteration of the loop, and instead compute them only once before the loop. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for large loops or expensive computations.
