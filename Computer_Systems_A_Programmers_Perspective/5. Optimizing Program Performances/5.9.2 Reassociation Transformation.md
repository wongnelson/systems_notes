## What is Reassociation Transformation?

Reassociation transformation is a technique used to improve performance by breaking sequential dependencies, allowing a greater degree of parallelism in the computation. This technique involves rearranging the order in which elements are combined in a loop, which can significantly affect the program's performance. Reassociation can be applied in loop unrolling, where it is referred to as "k × 1a" unrolling.

Example:
```c
/* 2x loop unrolling with reassociation */
for (i = 0; i < N-1; i+=2) {
    sum1 += a[i] * b[i];
    sum2 += a[i+1] * b[i+1];
}

/* handle any remaining elements */
for (; i < N; i++) {
    sum += a[i] * b[i];
}

sum += sum1 + sum2;
```
In the reassociation transformation example, we've broken the computation into two separate accumulations (sum1 and sum2) and then combined the results at the end. This allows more parallelism in the computation and can improve performance.

## What are the benefits of reassociation transformation?

The reassociation transformation can reduce the number of operations along the critical path in a computation, resulting in better performance by better utilizing the multiple functional units and their pipelining capabilities. For example, in the case of integer addition and multiplication, reassociation transformation can significantly improve the performance by allowing more operations to be performed in parallel.

## When is reassociation transformation not recommended?

Reassociation transformation is not recommended for floating-point operations, as they are not guaranteed to be associative. Most compilers will not attempt any reassociations of floating-point operations due to the risk of generating different results for unusual data patterns. Instead, unrolling a loop and accumulating multiple values in parallel is generally a more reliable way to achieve improved program performance.

## How does the reassociation transformation affect performance in loop unrolling?

Reassociation transformation in loop unrolling (k × 1a unrolling) can yield performance results similar to what is achieved by maintaining k separate accumulators with k × k unrolling. In all cases, the performance comes close to the throughput bounds imposed by the functional units. This improvement is achieved by reducing the number of operations along the critical path in a computation, allowing better utilization of the available functional units and their pipelining capabilities.

## How does reassociation transformation affect the outcome of floating-point operations?

Reassociation transformation can change the order in which floating-point elements are combined together, which may affect the final result due to the non-associative nature of floating-point operations. However, for most applications, the difference in the outcome is likely to be immaterial. It is essential to assess whether the reassociation transformation will significantly affect the outcome before applying it to floating-point operations

What is SIMD?

SIMD stands for "Single Instruction, Multiple Data," an execution model that operates on entire vectors of data within single instructions. SIMD allows for greater parallelism and performance improvements in certain types of computations, such as vector operations. Intel introduced the SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) instructions in 1999, with more recent versions being named advanced vector extensions (AVX).

Suppose we have two arrays, `a` and `b`, each containing 8 single-precision floating-point numbers. We want to compute the element-wise sum of the two arrays and store the result in a third array `c`.

Without SIMD, we might write a loop that looks like this:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}
```
With SIMD, we can use an instruction like `addps` (add packed single precision) to perform the operation on all 8 elements simultaneously:
```c
__m256 a_vec = _mm256_loadu_ps(a);  // load 8 floats from a into a SIMD register
__m256 b_vec = _mm256_loadu_ps(b);  // load 8 floats from b into a SIMD register
__m256 sum = _mm256_add_ps(a_vec, b_vec);  // add the two vectors element-wise
_mm256_storeu_ps(c, sum);  // store the result back to memory
```
This code loads the 8 floats from `a` and `b` into two SIMD registers, adds them element-wise using the `addps` instruction, and stores the result back to memory in the `c` array. The entire operation is performed in a single instruction, allowing for greater parallelism and potentially faster performance.

## What are AVX vector registers?

AVX vector registers are a special set of vector registers named %ymm0-%ymm15, used for SIMD operations in the AVX instruction set. Current AVX vector registers are 32 bytes long, which means each register can hold eight 32-bit numbers or four 64-bit numbers, where the numbers can be either integer or floating-point values.

## How do AVX instructions perform vector operations?

AVX instructions can perform vector operations on the contents of AVX vector registers, such as adding or multiplying sets of values in parallel. For example, consider the following instruction:

`vmulps (%rcx), %ymm0, %ymm1`

If YMM register `%ymm0` contains eight single-precision floating-point numbers (a0, ..., a7) and `%rcx` contains the memory address of a sequence of eight single-precision floating-point numbers (b0, ..., b7), this instruction reads the eight values from memory, performs eight multiplications in parallel (ai ← ai · bi, for 0 < i ≤ 7), and stores the resulting eight products in vector register `%ymm1`.

## How does gcc support SIMD operations?

gcc supports extensions to the C language that let programmers express a program in terms of vector operations that can be compiled into the vector instructions of AVX (as well as code based on the earlier SSE instructions). This coding style is preferable to writing code directly in assembly language since gcc can also generate code for the vector instructions found on other processors.

## What performance improvements can be achieved using SIMD?

Using a combination of gcc instructions, loop unrolling, and multiple accumulators, SIMD can achieve significant performance improvements for combining functions. The chart below shows the performance comparison between scalar code and vector code:
```c
Integer      Floating point
int  long    int  long    +    *    +    *    +    *    +    *
Scalar 10×10            0.54 1.01 0.55 1.00 1.01 0.51 1.01 0.52
Scalar throughput bound 0.50 0.50 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.50 0.50
Vector 8×8              0.05 0.24 0.13 1.51 0.12 0.08 0.25 0.16
Vector throughput bound 0.06 0.12 0.12 —    0.12 0.06 0.25 0.12
```
The vector code achieves almost an eightfold improvement on the four 32-bit cases and a fourfold improvement on three of the four 64-bit cases. Only the long integer multiplication code does not perform well when expressed in vector code, as the AVX instruction set does not include parallel multiplication of 64-bit integers.
