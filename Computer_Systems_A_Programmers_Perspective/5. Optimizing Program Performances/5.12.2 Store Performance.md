## What is store performance?

Store performance is related to the efficiency of store operations that write register values to memory. These operations can affect the overall performance of a program, particularly in relation to interactions with load operations.

## How does store operation pipelining work?

In most cases, the store operation can operate in a fully pipelined mode, beginning a new store on every cycle. This allows for continuous execution of store operations without waiting for each one to complete, resulting in more efficient performance.

Example:
```c
/* Set elements of array to 0 */
void clear_array(long *dest, long n) {
	long i;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
		dest[i] = 0;
}
```

In the example above, the function sets the elements of an array `dest` of length `n` to zero. This code achieves a CPE (cycles per element) of 1.0, which is the best achievable performance on a machine with a single store functional unit This is because there is only one operation being performed on each element of the array, which is to set its value to 0. Since modern processors can typically perform a single store operation in one cycle, the CPE of the loop is 1.0. This means that for each element in the array, one cycle is required to perform the store operation. Hence, the best achievable performance on a machine with a single store functional unit is a CPE of 1.0. 

## What is a write/read dependency?

A write/read dependency occurs when the outcome of a memory read depends on a recent memory write. This phenomenon can cause slowdowns in processing when a load operation is affected by the result of a store operation.

Example:
```c
/* Write to dest, read from src */
void write_read(long *src, long *dst, long n)
{
	long cnt = n;
	long val = 0;

	while (cnt) {
		*dst = val;
		val = (*src)+1;
		cnt−;
	}
}
```
In the example above, function `write_read` highlights the interactions between stores and loads, illustrating the subtleties of the load and store operations.

## How does the processor handle memory operations efficiently?

The processor handles memory operations efficiently by taking advantage of potential parallelism when operations can proceed independently. Memory subsystems make use of many optimizations to handle memory operations effectively. These include pipelining, store buffers, and handling data dependencies between load and store operations.

## What is the difference between register and memory operations in terms of data dependencies?

With operations on registers, the processor can determine which instructions will affect others as they are being decoded into operations. However, with memory operations, the processor cannot predict which operations will affect others until the load and store addresses have been computed. This makes handling memory operations efficiently critical to the performance of many programs.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

Suppose we have the following code:
```c
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = a + b;
d = a * b;
```
In this example, the processor can determine the dependencies between the operations before they are executed. For example, it knows that the operation `c = a + b` depends on the values of `a` and `b`, so it will load `a` and `b` into registers, add them, and store the result in `c`. The operation `d = a * b` also depends on the values of `a` and `b`, so the processor can load `a` and `b` into registers, perform the multiplication, and store the result in `d`.

Now consider the following code:
```c
a = 1;
b = 2;
mem[0] = a + b;
d = mem[0] * b;
```
In this example, the processor cannot determine the dependencies between the operations until the load and store addresses have been computed. In particular, the operation `d = mem[0] * b` depends on the value stored in `mem[0]`, but the processor doesn't know what value will be stored there until the operation `mem[0] = a + b` has completed. So, the processor must wait until the memory operation has completed before it can proceed with the multiplication.

The second example would likely take one extra cycle compared to the first example, due to the memory operation `mem[0] = a + b`. The processor would have to wait for the memory operation to complete before it can proceed with the multiplication in the next instruction.

In general, memory operations are slower than register operations, because accessing memory takes longer than accessing a register. This is why it's important for processors to handle memory operations efficiently. By doing so, they can minimize the impact of memory operations on performance and ensure that programs run as quickly as possible.

## How do store buffers work?

Store buffers are used to maintain a buffer of pending writes in the store unit of a processor. These buffers allow a series of store operations to be executed without having to wait for each one to update the cache. When a load operation occurs, it must check the entries in the store buffer for matching addresses. If it finds a match, it retrieves the corresponding data entry as the result of the load operation.

Here's an example to illustrate how store buffers work:

Suppose we have the following code:
```c
a = 1;
b = 2;
mem[0] = a;
mem[1] = b;
c = mem[0] + mem[1];
```

In this example, the store unit in the processor would buffer the two store operations `mem[0] = a` and `mem[1] = b`. Instead of updating the cache immediately, the store unit would wait until it has several store operations to perform, then update the cache all at once. This allows the processor to execute the store operations more efficiently, without having to wait for each one to complete before starting the next one.

When the load operation `c = mem[0] + mem[1]` occurs, the processor would check the entries in the store buffer for matching addresses. If it finds a match for `mem[0]` or `mem[1]`, it would retrieve the corresponding data entry from the store buffer, instead of from the cache. This ensures that the latest data is used in the calculation of `c`.

Here's a simple example of how the store buffer might look like:
```c
Store Buffer:
--------------
Address: mem[0]    Data: 1
Address: mem[1]    Data: 2

Cache:
-------
Address: mem[0]    Data: (not updated yet)
Address: mem[1]    Data: (not updated yet)
```
In this example, the store buffer contains the two store operations `mem[0] = a` and `mem[1] = b`. When the load operation `c = mem[0] + mem[1]` occurs, the processor would use the data in the store buffer, rather than the cache, to perform the calculation. Once the store buffer has been processed, the cache would be updated with the latest data.

## How do store and load execution units interact?

Store and load execution units interact through their store buffers and the checking of addresses for matching entries. When a store operation is executed, it creates an entry in the store buffer with its address and data. When a load operation is executed, it checks the entries in the store buffer for matching addresses. If a match is found, the load operation retrieves the corresponding data entry from the store buffer as its result.

Here's an example to illustrate how the store and load execution units interact through their store buffers:

Suppose we have the following code:
```c
a = 1;
b = 2;
mem[0] = a;
c = mem[0] + b;
```
In this example, when the store operation `mem[0] = a` is executed, it creates an entry in the store buffer with its address `mem[0]` and data `a`. The store buffer might look like this:

```c
Store Buffer:
--------------
Address: mem[0]    Data: 1
```
When the load operation `c = mem[0] + b` is executed, the load execution unit checks the entries in the store buffer for matching addresses. It finds a match for `mem[0]`, so it retrieves the corresponding data entry `1` from the store buffer as the result of the load operation. The calculation `c = mem[0] + b` can then be performed using the data from the store buffer.

After the store buffer has been processed, the cache would be updated with the latest data. In this example, the cache might look like this:
```c
Cache:
-------
Address: mem[0]    Data: 1
```
In this way, the store and load execution units interact through their store buffers to ensure that the latest data is used in the calculation of `c`. The store buffer acts as a buffer of pending writes, allowing the store execution unit to execute store operations more efficiently, while the load execution unit retrieves the latest data from the store buffer as needed.

## Why is the separation of address computation and data storage important for program performance?

The separation of address computation and data storage is important for program performance because it allows these two computations to be performed independently. This independence can improve the efficiency of memory operations and potentially allow for parallel execution of instructions that do not depend on one another.

Example:
```c
Inner loop of write_read
src in %rdi, dst in %rsi, val in %rax
.L3:           loop:
 movq   %rax, (%rsi)     Write val to dst
 movq   (%rdi), %rax     t = *src
 addq   $1, %rax         val = t+1
 subq   $1, %rdx         cnt−
 jne    . L3             If != 0, goto loop
```
The `movq %rax, (%rsi)` instruction is decoded into separate operations by the processor's instruction decoder. The instruction decoder is responsible for breaking down each instruction into individual micro-operations or micro-ops that can be executed by the execution units in the processor.

In this case, the `movq %rax, (%rsi)` instruction is decoded into two micro-ops: one to compute the store address `(%rsi)`, and one to store the data in the register `%rax` to the computed address.

The first micro-op computes the effective address of the store operation, which is the value stored in the `%rsi` register plus any offset. This operation is performed by the address generation unit (AGU) in the processor.

The second micro-op stores the data from the `%rax` register to the computed address. This operation is performed by the store execution unit.

By breaking down the `movq %rax, (%rsi)` instruction into separate operations, the processor can perform these operations in parallel, which can improve performance. For example, while the AGU is computing the effective address for one store operation, the store execution unit can be storing data from a previous operation to memory.

This separation also allows for better resource utilization and potential parallelism, as different execution units can work on different micro-ops at the same time.

## How does write_read function performance vary depending on address matching?

The performance of the `write_read` function varies depending on whether the source and destination addresses match or not.

1.  If the source and destination addresses differ, the load and store operations can proceed independently, and the only critical path is formed by decrementing the `cnt` variable, resulting in a CPE bound of 1.0.
    
2.  If the source and destination addresses match, the data dependency between the `s_data` and `load` instructions causes a critical path to form involving data being stored, loaded, and incremented. These three operations in sequence require a total of around 7 clock cycles, resulting in a higher CPE.
    

These variations in performance highlight the importance of efficient memory operation handling in program execution.
