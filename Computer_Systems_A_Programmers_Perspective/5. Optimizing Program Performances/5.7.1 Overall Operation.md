## What is the overall operation of a modern microprocessor?

A modern microprocessor, such as the Intel Core i7, is described as superscalar and out-of-order. Superscalar means it can perform multiple operations on every clock cycle, and out-of-order means the order in which instructions execute need not correspond to their ordering in the machine-level program. The overall design of a modern microprocessor consists of two main parts: the instruction control unit (ICU) and the execution unit (EU). The ICU reads a sequence of instructions from memory and generates a set of primitive operations, which the EU then executes.

### Why is branch prediction important in modern microprocessors?

Branch prediction is a technique used by modern microprocessors to guess whether a branch will be taken and predict the target address for the branch. This allows the processor to fetch, decode, and execute instructions speculatively before it has been determined whether the branch prediction was correct. If the prediction was incorrect, the processor resets the state to the branch point and begins fetching and executing instructions in the other direction. Branch prediction is important because mispredictions can incur a significant cost in performance.

Example: Consider a simple `if` statement in a program:
```c
if (x > 0) {
  // Code block A
} else {
  // Code block B
}
```

The processor might predict that `x` is greater than 0 and speculatively execute Code block A. If it turns out that the prediction was correct, the execution continues smoothly. If the prediction was incorrect, the processor must discard the work done on Code block A, and start executing Code block B, which can lead to performance penalties.

### How does instruction decoding work in modern microprocessors?

The instruction decoding logic takes actual program instructions and converts them into a set of primitive operations, sometimes referred to as micro-operations. Each of these operations performs some simple computational task, such as adding two numbers, reading data from memory, or writing data to memory. For machines with complex instructions, like x86 processors, an instruction can be decoded into multiple operations.

Example: Consider the following x86 instruction:

`addq %rax, 8(%rdx)`

This instruction would be decoded into three operations:

1.  Load a value from memory (address `%rdx + 8`) into the processor
2.  Add the loaded value to the value in register `%rax`
3.  Store the result back to memory (address `%rdx + 8`)

### What are the functional units in a modern microprocessor?

The execution unit (EU) receives operations from the instruction fetch unit and dispatches them to a set of functional units that perform the actual operations. These functional units are specialized to handle different types of operations. Some examples of functional units are:

1.  Arithmetic units: These units perform integer and floating-point arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.  Load units: These units handle operations that read data from memory into the processor. They have an adder to perform address computations.
3.  Store units: These units handle operations that write data from the processor to memory. They also have an adder to perform address computations.

In our Intel Core i7 Haswell reference machine example, there are eight functional units:

1.  Integer arithmetic, floating-point multiplication, integer and floating-point division, branches
2.  Integer arithmetic, floating-point addition, integer multiplication, floating-point multiplication
3.  Load, address computation
4.  Load, address computation
5.  Store
6.  Integer arithmetic
7.  Integer arithmetic, branches
8.  Store address computation

### How do latency, issue time, and capacity affect the performance of a modern microprocessor?

Latency indicates the total number of clock cycles required to perform an operation, issue time indicates the minimum number of cycles between two independent operations, and capacity indicates how many of these operations can be issued simultaneously.

Example
| Operation                   | Latency | Issue | Capacity |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Integer Addition            | 1      | 1     | 4        |
| Floating-point Addition     | 3      | 1     | 1        |
| Integer Multiplication      | 3      | 1     | 1        |
| Floating-point Multiplication | 5     | 1     | 2        |
| Integer Division            | 3-30   | 3-30  | 1        |
| Floating-point Division     | 3-15   | 3-15  | 1        |

In this example, the processor can issue four integer additions simultaneously with a latency of 1 cycle, while it can only issue one floating-point addition at a time with a latency of 3 cycles. The performance of a program depends on the types of operations and their latencies, issue times, and capacities.

### How does register renaming help with speculative execution in modern microprocessors?

Register renaming is a mechanism for controlling the communication of operands among the execution units. It helps to forward values directly from one operation to another, rather than being written to and read from the register file, enabling the second operation to begin as soon as the first has completed.

When an instruction updating register `r` is decoded, a unique identifier tag `t` is generated for the result of the operation. An entry `(r, t)` is added to a table maintaining the association between program register `r` and tag `t`. When a subsequent instruction using register `r` as an operand is decoded, the operation sent to the execution unit will contain `t` as the source for the operand value. When an execution unit completes the first operation, it generates a result `(v, t)`, indicating that the operation with tag `t` produced value `v`. Any operation waiting for `t` as a source will then use `v` as the source value, a form of data forwarding.

Register renaming allows an entire sequence of operations to be performed speculatively, even though the registers are updated only after the processor is certain of the branch outcomes.

This diagram represents the key components of a modern microprocessor. The instruction control unit reads instructions from the instruction cache and fetches them using the fetch control mechanism. These instructions are sent to the execution unit, which is responsible for executing the operations.

The execution unit is comprised of functional units, including load and store units, which interact with the data cache for reading and writing memory. The operation results are then communicated back to the instruction control unit.
