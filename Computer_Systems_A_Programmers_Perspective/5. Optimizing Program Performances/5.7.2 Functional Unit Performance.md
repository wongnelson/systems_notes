## What is functional unit performance and how is it characterized?

Functional unit performance refers to the ability of a processor's functional units to execute operations efficiently. It is characterized by latency, issue time, and capacity. Latency is the total time required to perform an operation, issue time is the minimum number of clock cycles between two independent operations of the same type, and capacity indicates the number of functional units capable of performing that operation.

### How do integer and floating-point operations differ in terms of latency?

The latencies of integer operations are typically lower than those of floating-point operations. This is because floating-point operations are more complex and require more time to complete.

### What does it mean for a functional unit to be fully pipelined?

A fully pipelined functional unit is designed with multiple stages, each performing part of the operation. This allows the unit to start a new operation every clock cycle, resulting in an issue time of 1 cycle. Fully pipelined functional units can achieve a maximum throughput of 1 operation per clock cycle.

### Why are some operations, like division, not pipelined?

Division is a comparatively costly operation that is relatively infrequent and difficult to implement with short latency or full pipelining. Implementing pipelining for division would require more hardware, which would take up valuable space on the microprocessor chip.

### How do latency, issue times, and capacities of arithmetic operations affect the performance of combining functions?

The performance of combining functions can be affected by the latencies, issue times, and capacities of the arithmetic operations in two ways:

1.  **Latency bound**: This sets a minimum value for the CPE (cycles per element) for any function that must perform the combining operation in a strict sequence. Functions with high latency will have a higher latency bound.
2.  **Throughput bound**: This sets a minimum bound for the CPE based on the maximum rate at which the functional units can produce results. For example, if there is only one integer multiplier with an issue time of 1 clock cycle, the processor cannot sustain a rate of more than 1 multiplication per clock cycle.

These bounds can limit the overall performance of combining functions in different ways, depending on the specific operations involved and the characteristics of the functional units.
