## What is the problem with procedure calls in a program?

Procedure calls can incur overhead and block most forms of program optimization. They can slow down a program's execution, especially when repeatedly called within a loop. Bounds checking, for example, may be a useful feature when dealing with arbitrary array accesses, but it can also be a source of inefficiency when it is clear that all references will be valid.

## How can we reduce the overhead of procedure calls in a loop?

One way to reduce the overhead of procedure calls in a loop is by eliminating function calls within the loop and accessing the data directly. For example, instead of calling a function like `get_vec_element` on every loop iteration to retrieve the next vector element, we can use a function like `get_vec_start` to obtain the starting address of the data array and then access the array directly within the loop.

```c
data_t *get_vec_start(vec_ptr v) {
    return v->data;
}

void combine3(vec_ptr v, data_t *dest) {
    long i;
    long length = vec_length(v);
    data_t *data = get_vec_start(v);

    *dest = IDENT;
    for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        *dest = *dest OP data[i];
    }
}
```

A simpler example:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    foo(i);
}
```
In this code, the loop is calling the `foo` function on each iteration. If `foo` is a relatively simple function, the overhead of calling it repeatedly in the loop could be significant. To reduce this overhead, we can use loop unrolling to call `foo` multiple times within each iteration of the loop:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
    foo(i);
    foo(i + 1);
    foo(i + 2);
    foo(i + 3);
}
```
In this code, we've unrolled the loop by a factor of 4, so each iteration of the loop now calls `foo` four times, with different arguments. This can reduce the overhead of the procedure calls by up to a factor of 4, since we're now making fewer calls to `foo` overall.

However, it's important to note that loop unrolling may not always result in improved performance, and can sometimes even have a negative impact on performance, especially if the loop body is large or if there are issues with cache locality. Therefore, it's important to benchmark the code and carefully consider the trade-offs before using loop unrolling as an optimization technique.

## Question: What is the trade-off when eliminating function calls within a loop?

Eliminating function calls within a loop may lead to improved performance, but it can also impair program modularity. In principle, the user of the abstract data type should not even need to know that the vector contents are stored as an array rather than another data structure like a linked list. However, a more pragmatic programmer might argue that this transformation is a necessary step toward achieving high-performance results.

## Question: Does eliminating function calls within the loop always lead to a performance gain?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define N 1000000

int arr[N];

int get_vec_element(int* vec, int i) {
    return vec[i];
}

int sum_elements(int* vec, int len) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        sum += get_vec_element(vec, i);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    printf("Sum (loop): %d\n", sum);
    
    sum = sum_elements(arr, N);
    printf("Sum (function): %d\n", sum);
    
    return 0;
}
```
Not necessarily. In the example given, there is no apparent performance improvement after eliminating the function call in the loop. In fact, the performance for integer sum has gotten slightly worse. This is because other operations in the inner loop are forming a bottleneck that limits the performance more than the call to `get_vec_element`. However, this transformation could be viewed as one of a series of steps that will ultimately lead to greatly improved performance.

## Does the compiler do a good job of loop unrolling by default

Modern compilers are typically very good at performing loop unrolling and other optimization techniques automatically. In fact, many compilers are able to perform loop unrolling and other optimizations by default, without any explicit directives from the programmer.

When the compiler optimizes code, it analyzes the code and applies a variety of transformations to improve performance. Loop unrolling is one of the optimizations that compilers are typically able to perform automatically, and many compilers will automatically unroll loops when they believe it will result in better performance.

However, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of loop unrolling and other optimizations can depend on a variety of factors, such as the specific code being compiled, the target architecture, and the optimization level used. Additionally, in some cases, it may be necessary to manually perform loop unrolling or other optimizations to achieve the best possible performance.

In general, it's a good idea to benchmark the code to determine whether loop unrolling or other optimizations are actually improving performance in a specific case. If the performance gains are significant, it may be worth exploring further optimizations or adjusting the optimization level used by the compiler.
