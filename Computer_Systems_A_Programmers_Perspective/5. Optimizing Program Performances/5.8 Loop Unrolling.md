## What is loop unrolling?

Loop unrolling is a program transformation that reduces the number of iterations for a loop by increasing the number of elements computed on each iteration. It can improve performance by reducing operations that do not contribute directly to the program result and by exposing ways to further transform the code to reduce the number of operations in the critical paths of the overall computation.

## How does 2x1 loop unrolling work?

In 2x1 loop unrolling, the loop steps through the array two elements at a time, incrementing the loop index by 2 on each iteration, and applying the combining operation to array elements i and i+1 in a single iteration. This can be seen in the example code below:
```c
/* 2 x 1 loop unrolling */
void combine5(vec_ptr v, data_t *dest)
{
    long i;
    long length = vec_length(v);
    long limit = length-1;
    data_t *data = get_vec_start(v);
    data_t acc = IDENT;

    /* Combine 2 elements at a time */
    for (i = 0; i < limit; i+=2) {
        acc = (acc OP data[i]) OP data[i+1];
    }

    /* Finish any remaining elements */
    for (;i < length; i++) {
        acc = acc OP data[i];
    }
    *dest = acc;
}
```
"OP" stands for an arithmetic operation that will be performed on the two elements being combined. In this code snippet, the operation is represented as `OP`. The actual operation will be determined by the macro definition of `OP`, which will be defined elsewhere in the code or passed as a command-line argument to the compiler. For example, if `OP` is defined as `*`, the operation performed will be multiplication.

## How do we handle arbitrary vector lengths in loop unrolling?

To handle arbitrary vector lengths, we need to ensure that the first loop does not overrun the array bounds. For a vector of length n, we set the loop limit to be n-1, so the maximum array index i+1 will satisfy i+1<(n-1)+1=n.

## How can we generalize loop unrolling for any factor k?

To generalize loop unrolling for any factor k, we set the upper limit to be n-k+1 and apply the combining operation to elements i through i+k-1 within the loop. The loop index i is incremented by k in each iteration. The maximum array index i+k-1 will then be less than n. A second loop is included to step through the final few elements of the vector one at a time. The body of this loop will be executed between 0 and k-1 times.
```c
void combine_k(vec_ptr v, data_t *dest, int k)
{
    long i;
    long length = vec_length(v);
    long limit = length - k + 1;
    data_t *data = get_vec_start(v);
    data_t acc = IDENT;

    /* Combine k elements at a time */
    for (i = 0; i < limit; i += k) {
        acc = acc OP data[i];
        acc = acc OP data[i+1];
        acc = acc OP data[i+2];
    }

    /* Finish any remaining elements */
    for (; i < length; i++) {
        acc = acc OP data[i];
    }
    *dest = acc;
}
```
In this example, we pass in `k=3` as a parameter to generalize the loop unrolling for any factor `k`. The upper limit of the loop is set to `n-k+1` to ensure that the loop does not overrun the array bounds. Inside the loop, we apply the combining operation to elements `i` through `i+k-1`. The loop index `i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration to skip over the `k` elements that were already combined. Finally, we have a second loop that steps through any remaining elements of the vector one at a time, and we apply the combining operation to each element individually.

## What is kx1 loop unrolling?

kx1 loop unrolling refers to unrolling a loop by a factor of k and accumulating values in a single variable, such as `acc` in the example code. This transformation can reduce the effect of loop overhead.

Here is an example of `kx1` loop unrolling in C code:
```c
void sum_array(int *array, int n, int *result) {
    int i, acc = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i += 4) {
        acc += array[i] + array[i + 1] + array[i + 2] + array[i + 3];
    }
    for (; i < n; i++) {
        acc += array[i];
    }
    *result = acc;
}
```
In this example, the loop is unrolled by a factor of 4 using `kx1` loop unrolling. The loop accumulates the sum of four consecutive elements in the array `array` in the variable `acc`. The loop index `i` is incremented by 4 in each iteration, and the loop runs until `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. The final few elements of the array are accumulated in a separate loop that executes between 0 and 3 times, depending on the size of the array modulo 4. This loop sums the remaining elements one at a time, and adds them to `acc`. The final sum is stored in the variable pointed to by `result`.
