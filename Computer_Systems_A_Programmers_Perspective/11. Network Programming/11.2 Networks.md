## What is the role of networks in client-server communication?

Networks are essential for client-server communication, especially when clients and servers run on separate hosts. Networks provide the hardware and software resources needed for data transfer between hosts. From a programmer's perspective, a network is an I/O device that serves as a source and sink for data.

## How is a network host organized in terms of hardware?

A network host's hardware organization includes an adapter plugged into an expansion slot on the I/O bus, which provides the physical interface to the network. Data received from the network are copied from the adapter across the I/O and memory buses into memory, typically by a DMA (Direct Memory Access) transfer. Similarly, data can also be copied from memory to the network.
```c
+-------+    +------+    +------+
|       |    |      |    |      |
| Host  |<-->| I/O  |<-->|Adapter|
|       |    | Bus  |    |      |
+-------+    +------+    +------+
```
## What is a LAN and how is Ethernet related to it?

A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that spans a building or a campus. Ethernet, developed in the mid-1970s at Xerox PARC, is the most popular LAN technology. Ethernet has evolved from 3 Mb/s to 10 Gb/s, providing a high-speed network infrastructure for LANs.

## How does an Ethernet segment work?

An Ethernet segment consists of wires (usually twisted pairs) and a small box called a hub. Ethernet segments typically span small areas, such as a room or a floor in a building. Each wire has the same maximum bit bandwidth (e.g., 100 Mb/s or 1 Gb/s). One end is attached to an adapter on a host, and the other end is attached to a port on the hub. A hub copies every bit it receives on each port to every other port, enabling every host to see every bit.

## What is a frame in Ethernet communication?

A frame is a chunk of bits sent by a host to any other host on the Ethernet segment. Each frame includes header bits that identify the source and destination of the frame and the frame length, followed by a payload of data bits. Every host adapter sees the frame, but only the destination host reads it.
```c
+--------+--------+------+--------+-----------------+-------+
| Preamble | SFD |  DA   |   SA   | Length/Type | Data | FCS  |
+--------+--------+------+--------+-----------------+-------+
```
Where:

-   **Preamble**: A sequence of alternating 1s and 0s to help synchronize the sender and receiver.
-   **SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)**: A special byte sequence that indicates the start of the frame.
-   **DA (Destination Address)**: The MAC address of the destination host on the Ethernet segment. 
-   **SA (Source Address)**: The address of the source host on the Ethernet segment.
-   **Length/Type**: The length of the data payload or the type of the Ethernet frame.
-   **Data**: The payload of data bits being sent.
-   **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**: A checksum for error detection.

Each host adapter on the Ethernet segment sees the frame, but only the host with the matching destination address processes and reads the frame.

## Is a frame like a packet?
Yes, a frame and a packet are related concepts in networking.

A frame is a unit of data that is transmitted over a network, and it contains the data that is being sent, along with header and trailer information. The header information includes information such as the source and destination addresses, while the trailer information includes error detection and correction codes.

A packet is similar to a frame in that it also contains data and header information. However, the term "packet" is typically used to refer to the data and header information (sometimes called the "internet" header) that is being sent at the network layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model. The network layer is responsible for routing and forwarding packets between different networks.

So, in a sense, a packet can be considered to be a type of frame, as it contains the data and header information that is being sent over the network. However, the term "frame" is typically used to refer to the unit of data that is being transmitted at the data link layer of the OSI model, which is responsible for transmitting data over a single network segment.

## How do bridged Ethernets work?

Bridged Ethernets are larger LANs created by connecting multiple Ethernet segments using wires and small boxes called bridges. Bridged Ethernets can span entire buildings or campuses. Bridges automatically learn over time which hosts are reachable from which ports and selectively copy frames from one port to another only when necessary. This makes better use of the available wire bandwidth compared to hubs.

## What is the difference between "internet" and "Internet"?

The term "internet" (lowercase) denotes the general concept of interconnected networks, while "Internet" (uppercase) refers to a specific implementation, the global IP Internet.

## How are LANs represented in diagrams?

To simplify LAN representations in diagrams, hubs, bridges, and the wires connecting them are often drawn as a single horizontal line.
```c
+-----+-----+-----+-----+---+
|HostA|HostB| HostC | HostD | 
+-----+-----+-----+-----+---+
```

## What is the role of routers in connecting LANs and WANs?
Routers are specialized computers that connect multiple LANs and WANs that are incompatible with each other. They have a port or adapter for each network they are connected to, enabling them to connect and facilitate communication between these networks. WANs, or wide area networks, can span a large geographic area and can be used to connect different LANs, as well as other types of networks and devices. For example, high-speed point-to-point phone connections are one example of a WAN, but WANs can also use other types of connections such as satellite links, microwave links, or the internet.

## What is an internet, and how is it formed?

An internet is an interconnected network formed by connecting multiple incompatible LANs and WANs using routers. Internets can consist of different LANs and WANs with different and incompatible technologies. The crucial property of an internet is that it can enable communication across these varied networks.

## How does the internet protocol enable communication across different networks?

The internet protocol enables communication across different networks by providing a layer of protocol software running on each host and router that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">smooths out the differences between the networks</mark>. The protocol must provide two basic capabilities:

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink:</mark>
The phrase "smooths out the differences between the networks" means that the Internet Protocol (IP) helps to overcome the differences between various networks, allowing for communication between them.

Networks can have different underlying technologies, protocols, and address assignment methods, which can make it difficult for devices on different networks to communicate with each other. The IP provides a layer of protocol software that runs on each host and router, and it acts as a common language that allows devices on different networks to communicate with each other.

By standardizing the way that data is packaged and addressed, IP enables communication between networks that would otherwise be incompatible. The IP helps to "smooth out" the differences between these networks, making it possible for devices to exchange information even if they are using different technologies and protocols. This is an important aspect of the Internet and allows for the seamless exchange of information between networks, regardless of their underlying differences.

1.  **Naming scheme**: The Internet Protocol (IP) defines a uniform format for host addresses, called IP addresses, which are used to identify hosts on the internet. The IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to the internet, and it serves two main functions: identifying the host, and providing the location of the host in the network.

Here's an example of a naming scheme using IP addresses: Suppose there are two computers, A and B, connected to the internet. Computer A has the IP address 192.168.1.100 and computer B has the IP address 192.168.1.101. These IP addresses are unique and identify each computer on the internet.

When computer A wants to send a packet of data to computer B, it uses the IP address of computer B as the destination address in the packet header. The packet is then sent over the internet and delivered to computer B, where it is processed based on the destination IP address.

In this example, the IP addresses are used as a naming scheme to identify each host on the internet and provide a uniform format for addressing. This allows for communication between different devices and networks connected to the internet, regardless of their underlying LAN technologies.
    
2.  **Delivery mechanism**: The internet protocol defines a uniform way to bundle up data bits into discrete chunks called packets, smoothing out differences in bit encoding and frame packaging among different networking technologies. A packet consists of a header (containing packet size and source and destination host addresses) and a payload (containing data bits sent from the source host).

## What are the eight basic steps of transferring data across incompatible LANs using the internet protocol?

The example given consists of two LANs connected by a router, where a client on host A (attached to LAN1) sends data to a server on host B (attached to LAN2). The steps are:

1.  The client on host A invokes a system call, copying the data from the client's virtual address space into a kernel buffer. A kernel buffer is a region of memory that is managed by the operating system kernel, and it is used to temporarily store data that is being transmitted over the network.
    
2.  The protocol software (Like TCP/IP) on host A creates a LAN1 frame by appending an internet header and a LAN1 frame header to the data. The internet header is addressed to internet host B, and the LAN1 frame header is addressed to the router. The frame is then passed to the adapter.

3.  The LAN1 adapter (also known as a network interface card (NIC) or a network adapter) copies the frame to the network.
    
4.  When the frame reaches the router, the router's LAN1 adapter reads it from the wire and passes it to the protocol software.
    
5.  The router fetches the destination internet address from the internet packet header, uses it as an index into a routing table to determine where to forward the packet (in this case, LAN2), strips off the old LAN1 frame header, prepends a new LAN2 frame header addressed to host B, and passes the resulting frame to the adapter. We need the router because the two LANs are incompatible.

6.  The router's LAN2 adapter copies the frame to the network.
    
7.  When the frame reaches host B, its adapter reads the frame from the wire and passes it to the protocol software.
    
8.  Finally, the protocol software on host B strips off the packet header and frame header, and the resulting data is eventually copied into the server's virtual address space when the server invokes a system call to read the data.

## What is encapsulation in the context of internetworking?

Encapsulation is the process of enclosing data from one protocol within another protocol's data. In the context of internetworking, encapsulation allows the transfer of data across incompatible networks by embedding the payload of an internet packet (the actual user data) within a frame specific to each LAN.

## What are some challenges when transferring data across different networks?

Some challenges when transferring data across different networks include handling different maximum frame sizes among networks, determining where routers should forward frames, updating routers when network topology changes, and dealing with lost packets.
