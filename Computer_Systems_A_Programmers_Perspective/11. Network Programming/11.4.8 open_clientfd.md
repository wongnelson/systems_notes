### What is the purpose of the helper functions for the sockets interface?

The helper functions for the sockets interface, such as `open_clientfd` and `open_listenfd`, are used to provide a higher-level abstraction to clients and servers when they want to communicate with each other. These functions make it more convenient to use the `getaddrinfo` function and the sockets interface, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.

### How does the open_clientfd function work?

The `open_clientfd` function establishes a connection with a server running on a host with a given hostname and listening for connection requests on a specified port number. It returns an open socket descriptor that is ready for input and output using the Unix I/O functions.

Here's the code for `open_clientfd`:
```c
int open_clientfd(char *hostname, char *port) {
    int clientfd;
    struct addrinfo hints, *listp, *p;

    /* Get a list of potential server addresses */
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; /* Open a connection */
	// these two lines are explained below
    hints.ai_flags = AI_NUMERICSERV; /* ... using a numeric port arg. */
    hints.ai_flags |= AI_ADDRCONFIG; /* Recommended for connections */
    Getaddrinfo(hostname, port, &hints, &listp);

    /* Walk the list for one that we can successfully connect to */
    for (p = listp; p; p = p->ai_next) {
        /* Create a socket descriptor */
        if ((clientfd = socket(p->ai_family, p->ai_socktype, p->ai_protocol)) < 0)
            continue; /* Socket failed, try the next */

        /* Connect to the server */
        if (connect(clientfd, p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) != -1)
            break; /* Success */
        Close(clientfd); /* Connect failed, try another */
    }

    /* Clean up */
    Freeaddrinfo(listp);
    if (!p) /* All connects failed */
        return -1;
    else    /* The last connect succeeded */
        return clientfd;
}
```
The function works as follows:

1.  It calls `getaddrinfo` to obtain a list of potential server addresses.
2.  It walks through the list of `addrinfo` structures, trying each entry in turn, until the calls to `socket` and `connect` succeed.
3.  If the connection fails, it closes the socket descriptor before trying the next entry.
4.  If the connection succeeds, it frees the list memory and returns the socket descriptor to the client.

This function is reentrant and protocol-independent, and there is no dependence on any particular version of IP in the code. The arguments to `socket` and `connect` are generated automatically by `getaddrinfo`, which allows the code to be clean and portable.

## Why set hints.ai_flags to AI_NUMERICSERV and then bitwise OR it with AI_ADDRCONFIG?
The bitwise OR operator `|` works by setting the specified flags in the `ai_flags` field without overwriting any previously set flags.

Each flag in the `ai_flags` field is represented by a unique bit value. The bitwise OR operator `|` sets the specified flags in the `ai_flags` field by ORing the current value of the `ai_flags` field with the bit value of the flag to be set. The OR operation results in a new value that has the specified flag set, while preserving any previously set flags.

For example, if the `ai_flags` field has the value `0x0001` (which represents the `AI_NUMERICSERV` flag set), and you want to set the `AI_ADDRCONFIG` flag, you can use the following code:
`hints.ai_flags |= AI_ADDRCONFIG;`

The `AI_ADDRCONFIG` flag is represented by the bit value `0x0002`. The OR operation between `0x0001` and `0x0002` results in a new value of `0x0003`, which represents both the `AI_NUMERICSERV` and `AI_ADDRCONFIG` flags set.

So, the bitwise OR operator `|` sets the specified flags in the `ai_flags` field without overwriting any previously set flags, by ORing the current value of the `ai_flags` field with the bit value of the flag to be set.
