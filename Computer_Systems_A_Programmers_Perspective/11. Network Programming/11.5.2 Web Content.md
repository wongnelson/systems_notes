## What is Web Content?

Web content refers to the sequence of bytes with an associated MIME type that is served to web clients by web servers. Web servers can provide content in two ways: serving static content (fetching a disk file and returning its contents) and serving dynamic content (running an executable file and returning its output).

## What are MIME types?

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types are used to indicate the type of content being sent or requested over the internet. They help web clients and servers understand how to handle the content being transmitted.

Here are a few common examples of MIME types:

-   text/plain: Indicates plain text content, such as the text of an email message or a file containing ASCII characters.
    
-   text/html: Indicates HTML content, such as the source code of a web page.
    
-   image/jpeg: Indicates a JPEG image file.
    
-   image/png: Indicates a PNG image file.
    
-   audio/mpeg: Indicates an MPEG audio file, such as an MP3 file.
    
-   application/pdf: Indicates a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
    
-   application/msword: Indicates a Microsoft Word document.
    
-   application/vnd.ms-excel: Indicates a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

## What is the difference between static and dynamic content?

Static content is a disk file that is directly served to the client without any changes, while dynamic content is generated by running an executable file, and its output is served to the client. Static content remains the same for all users, while dynamic content can change based on user inputs or other factors.

## What is a URL?

A URL (Universal Resource Locator) is a unique identifier for a file managed by a web server. It specifies the location of the file on the internet and includes information about the host, port number, and file path. For example:

`http://www.google.com:80/index.html`

## How are URLs for executable files different?

URLs for executable files can include program arguments after the filename. A `?` character separates the filename from the arguments, and each argument is separated by an `&` character. For example:

`http://bluefish.ics.cs.cmu.edu:8000/cgi-bin/adder?15000&213`

## How do clients and servers use different parts of a URL?

Clients use the prefix of a URL (e.g., `http://www.google.com:80`) to determine the server type, location, and listening port. Servers use the suffix of the URL (e.g., `/index.html`) to find the file on their filesystem and determine whether the request is for static or dynamic content.

## How do servers interpret the suffix of a URL?

There are several points to understand about how servers interpret the suffix of a URL:

1.  There are no standard rules for determining whether a URL refers to static or dynamic content. Each server has its own rules for the files it manages. A classic approach is to identify a set of directories, such as `cgi-bin`, where all executables must reside.
2.  The initial `/` in the suffix does not denote the Linux root directory. Instead, it denotes the home directory for the requested content. For example, a server might be configured so that all static content is stored in the `/usr/httpd/html` directory and all dynamic content is stored in the `/usr/httpd/cgi-bin` directory.
3.  The minimal URL suffix is the `/` character, which all servers expand to some default home page, such as `/index.html`. This expansion allows users to fetch a site's home page by simply typing its domain name into the browser. The browser appends the missing `/` to the URL and passes it to the server, which expands the `/` to a default filename.
