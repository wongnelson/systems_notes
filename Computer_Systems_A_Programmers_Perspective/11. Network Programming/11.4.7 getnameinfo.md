### What is the purpose of the getnameinfo function?

The `getnameinfo` function is the inverse of `getaddrinfo`. It converts a socket address structure to the corresponding host and service name strings. It is the modern replacement for the obsolete `gethostbyaddr` and `getservbyport` functions, and unlike those functions, it is reentrant and protocol-independent.

In the context of the `getnameinfo` function, being "reentrant" means that multiple threads can safely call the function at the same time, without interfering with each other's results. This is in contrast to functions like `gethostbyaddr` and `getservbyport`, which are not reentrant and can cause problems if called concurrently from multiple threads. By being reentrant, `getnameinfo` can be used safely in multi-threaded applications, making it a more modern and versatile solution for converting socket addresses to host and service names.

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t salen,
                char *host, size_t hostlen,
                char *service, size_t servlen, int flags);
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    struct sockaddr_in sa;
    char host[NI_MAXHOST];
    char service[NI_MAXSERV];

    sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
    sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
    sa.sin_port = htons(80);

    int ret = getnameinfo((struct sockaddr *) &sa, sizeof sa, host, sizeof host, service, sizeof service, 0);
    if (ret != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "getnameinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(ret));
        return 1;
    }

    printf("host=%s, service=%s\n", host, service);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `getnameinfo` function is used to convert a socket address stored in the `sa` structure to the corresponding host and service name strings, which are stored in the `host` and `service` arrays. The `ret` variable holds the return value of `getnameinfo`, which indicates whether the function was successful. If the return value is non-zero, the `gai_strerror` function is used to convert the error code to a human-readable string, which is then printed to the standard error stream. If the function was successful, the host and service name strings are printed to the standard output stream.

### How is the getnameinfo function used in a program?

The `getnameinfo` function is typically used in the following way:

1.  Pass a socket address structure, its size, and buffers for host and service name strings to `getnameinfo`.
2.  The function converts the socket address structure to the corresponding host and service name strings and copies them to the host and service buffers.
3.  If `getnameinfo` returns a nonzero error code, the application can call `gai_strerror` to convert the code to a message string.

### Can you provide an example of a program that uses getaddrinfo and getnameinfo?

The following program, called `hostinfo`, displays the mapping of a domain name to its associated IP addresses:
```c
#include "csapp.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    struct addrinfo *p, *listp, hints;
//the `buf` array is used to store the IP address returned by the `getnameinfo` function
    char buf[MAXLINE];
    int rc, flags;

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <domain name>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(0);
    }

    /* Get a list of addrinfo records */
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
    hints.ai_family = AF_INET; /* IPv4 only */
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; /* Connections only */
    if ((rc = getaddrinfo(argv[1], NULL, &hints, &listp)) != 0) { 
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(rc)); 
    exit(1); 
    }
/* Walk the list and display each IP address */
flags = NI_NUMERICHOST; /* Display address string instead of domain name */
for (p = listp; p; p = p->ai_next) {
    Getnameinfo(p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen, buf, MAXLINE, NULL, 0, flags);
    printf("%s\n", buf);
}

/* Clean up */
Freeaddrinfo(listp);

exit(0);

```
#### figure 11.17

This program uses `getaddrinfo` to get a list of `addrinfo` structures and then `getnameinfo` to convert each socket address to a dotted-decimal address string. The output displays the mapping of a domain name to its associated IP addresses, similar to the `nslookup` program.

### What are the flags for the getnameinfo function and their purpose?

The flags argument for the `getnameinfo` function is a bit mask that modifies the default behavior. You create it by OR-ing combinations of various values. Here are a couple of useful ones:

- `NI_NUMERICHOST`: By default, `getnameinfo` tries to return a domain name in the host buffer. Setting this flag will cause it to return a numeric address string instead.
- `NI_NUMERICSERV`: By default, `getnameinfo` will look in `/etc/services` and, if possible, return a service name instead of a port number. Setting this flag forces it to skip the lookup and simply return the port number.


## 11.4
The `getaddrinfo` and `getnameinfo` functions subsume the functionality of `inet_pton` and `inet_ntop`, respectively, and they provide a higher-level of abstraction that is independent of any particular address format. To convince yourself how handy this is, write a version of hostinfo ([Figure 11.17](file:///OPS/xhtml/fileP7000497027000000000000000007CC1.xhtml#P7000497027000000000000000007DE7)) that uses `inet_ntop` instead of `getnameinfo` to convert each socket address to a dotted-decimal address string.

A:
```c
#include "csapp.h"
#include <arpa/inet.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct addrinfo *p, *listp, hints;
    char buf[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];
    int rc;

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <domain name>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(0);
    }

    /* Get a list of addrinfo records */
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
    hints.ai_family = AF_INET; /* IPv4 only */
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; /* Connections only */
    if ((rc = getaddrinfo(argv[1], NULL, &hints, &listp)) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(rc));
        exit(1);
    }

    /* Walk the list and display each IP address */
    for (p = listp; p; p = p->ai_next) {
        struct sockaddr_in *sa = (struct sockaddr_in *) p->ai_addr;
        if (inet_ntop(AF_INET, &sa->sin_addr, buf, sizeof buf) == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "inet_ntop error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
            exit(1);
        }
        printf("%s\n", buf);
    }

    /* Clean up */
    freeaddrinfo(listp);

    exit(0);
}
```
In this version of the program, the `inet_ntop` function is used instead of `getnameinfo` to convert each socket address to a dotted-decimal IP address string. The `inet_ntop` function takes the address family (`AF_INET` for IPv4), a pointer to the binary representation of the IP address, a buffer to store the string representation of the address, and the size of the buffer. If the conversion is successful, `inet_ntop` returns a pointer to the string representation of the address, which is stored in the `buf` array. The updated version of the program also uses the `freeaddrinfo` function instead of `Freeaddrinfo` to release the memory used by the `addrinfo` structures.

The amount of extra work required to use `inet_ntop` instead of `getnameinfo` is minimal. The main difference is that the code must now manually cast the `ai_addr` field of the `addrinfo` structure to a `sockaddr_in` structure, and then extract the binary representation of the IP address using the `sin_addr` field. The code then uses `inet_ntop` to perform the conversion from binary to string representation.

This extra work is necessary because `inet_ntop` provides a lower-level of abstraction than `getnameinfo`, and does not provide the higher-level functionality of converting socket addresses to host and service names. However, the extra work is relatively minor, and the code is still relatively straightforward.
