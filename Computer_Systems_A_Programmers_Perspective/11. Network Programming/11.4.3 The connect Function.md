## 11.4.3 The `connect` Function

### What is the purpose of the `connect` function?

The `connect` function is used by a client to establish a connection with a server.
`int connect(int clientfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);`

### What are the arguments of the `connect` function?

The `connect` function has the following arguments:

-   `clientfd`: a socket file descriptor
-   `addr`: a pointer to the server's socket address structure
-   `addrlen`: the size of the socket address structure, typically `sizeof(sockaddr_in)`

### What does the `connect` function return?

The `connect` function returns `0` if the connection is successful, and `-1` on error.

### What happens after a successful connection is established using the `connect` function?

After a successful connection is established, the `clientfd` descriptor is ready for reading and writing. The resulting connection is characterized by the socket pair `(x:y, addr.sin_addr:addr.sin_port)`, where `x` is the client's IP address, and `y` is the ephemeral port that uniquely identifies the client process on the client host.

### What is the best practice for supplying arguments to the `connect` function?

The best practice is to use the `getaddrinfo` function to supply the arguments to `connect`. This function is covered in Section 11.4.8.

### Code Example
```c
#include <sys/socket.h> // for the socket function
#include <netinet/in.h> // for the sockaddr_in structure
#include <arpa/inet.h>  // for the inet_pton function
#include <unistd.h>     // for the close function
#include <stdio.h>      // for the printf and perror functions
#include <string.h>     // for the memset function

int main()
{
    int clientfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    if (clientfd == -1) {
        perror("socket error");
        return 1;
    }

    // Set up the server address structure
    // The sockaddr_in structure is used to represent an IP version 4 socket address
    // The memset function is used to initialize the structure with all zero bits
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
    memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));

    // Specify the address family for the server address
    // The sin_family field in the sockaddr_in structure specifies the address family for the socket address
    // The value AF_INET is used for IP version 4
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;

    // Specify the port number for the server address
    // The sin_port field in the sockaddr_in structure specifies the port number for the socket address
    // The htons function is used to convert the port number to network byte order (big-endian byte order)
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080);

    // Specify the IP address for the server address
    // The sin_addr field in the sockaddr_in structure specifies the IP address for the socket address
    // The inet_pton function is used to convert the string representation of the IP address to the binary representation
    inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &server_addr.sin_addr);

    // Establish the connection with the server
    // The connect function is used to establish a connection with a server
    // The first argument is the socket file descriptor
    // The second argument is a pointer to the server's socket address structure
    // The third argument is the size of the socket address structure
    int result = connect(clientfd, (struct sockaddr*) &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));

    // Check if the connection was established successfully
    // The connect function returns 0 on success and -1 on error, so if the return value is -1, an error occurred // The perror function is used to print an error message indicating the cause of the error if (result == -1) { perror("connect error"); return 1; }
// Receive data from the server
// The recv function is used to receive data from a socket
// The first argument is the socket file descriptor
// The second argument is a pointer to a buffer where the received data will be stored
// The third argument is the size of the buffer
// The fourth argument is a set of flags (0 in this case, indicating that no flags are set)
char buffer[100];
int bytes_received = recv(clientfd, buffer, 100, 0);

// Check if data was received successfully
// The recv function returns the number of bytes received on success, and -1 on error
// The perror function is used to print an error message indicating the cause of the error
if (bytes_received == -1) {
    perror("recv error");
    return 1;
}

// Terminate the received data with a null character
// The null character is used to indicate the end of a string in C
buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';

// Print the received data to the console
// The printf function is used to print the received data to the console
printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);

// Close the socket
// The close function is used to close a socket
// The argument is the socket file descriptor
close(clientfd);

// Exit the program
return 0;
```
This example shows how to use the connect function to establish a connection with a server and receive data from the server. The comments for each line of code provide detailed rationale for why the code was written in the way it was.`
