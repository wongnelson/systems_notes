## What is the global IP Internet?

The global IP Internet is the most famous and successful implementation of an internet. It has existed in one form or another since 1969. While the internal architecture of the Internet is complex and constantly changing, the organization of client-server applications has remained stable since the early 1980s.

## How do Internet hosts communicate?

Each Internet host runs software that implements the TCP/IP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which is supported by almost every modern computer system. Internet clients and servers communicate using a mix of sockets interface functions and Unix I/O functions.

## What is TCP/IP?

TCP/IP is a family of protocols, each of which contributes different capabilities. It is used by Internet hosts to communicate with each other. IP provides the basic naming scheme and a delivery mechanism that can send packets, known as datagrams, from one Internet host to any other host. TCP is a complex protocol that builds on IP to provide reliable full duplex (bidirectional) connections between processes.

## What is the role of the sockets interface in Internet communication?

The sockets interface functions are typically implemented as system calls that trap into the kernel and call various kernel-mode functions in TCP/IP. Sockets functions enable communication between Internet clients and servers.

## How are Internet hosts identified?

From a programmer's perspective, we can think of the Internet as a worldwide collection of hosts with the following properties:

1.  The set of hosts is mapped to a set of 32-bit IP addresses.
2.  The set of IP addresses is mapped to a set of identifiers called Internet domain names.

## What is the purpose of a connection in Internet communication?

A process on one Internet host can communicate with a process on any other Internet host over a connection. Connections enable reliable and bidirectional communication between processes on different hosts.

## What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?

IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) is the original Internet protocol with 32-bit addresses. In 1996, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed a new version called IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) that uses 128-bit addresses and was intended as the successor to IPv4.

## What is the adoption rate of IPv6 compared to IPv4?

As of 2015, almost 20 years after the introduction of IPv6, the vast majority of Internet traffic is still carried by IPv4 networks. For example, only 4 percent of users access Google services using IPv6.

## What are the advantages of IPv6?
1.  Larger address space: IPv6 has a much larger address space than IPv4, providing a virtually unlimited supply of unique IP addresses. This means that as the Internet continues to grow, there will be enough addresses for all devices, even as the number of connected devices continues to increase.
    
2.  Improved security: IPv6 includes built-in security features, such as IPSec, which provides stronger protection against hacking and other security threats.

IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is a protocol suite that provides security for Internet Protocol (IP) communications. IPSec is designed to provide confidentiality, data integrity, and authenticity for IP packets.

IPSec works by encrypting the data in IP packets and adding a secure header to the encrypted data. The secure header, known as the IPSec header, contains information about the security parameters used to protect the data, such as the encryption algorithm and key used.

IPSec operates at the network layer of the OSI model, and it can be used to secure a variety of IP-based communication protocols, including TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

IPSec operates in two modes: Transport mode and Tunnel mode. In Transport mode, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, while in Tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted.

IPSec uses a variety of encryption algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to encrypt the data in IP packets. The encryption algorithm used depends on the specific requirements of the network, such as the desired level of security and the available computational resources.
    
3.  Improved routing: IPv6 has a simplified header format, which makes it easier for routers to process and forward packets. This results in improved routing efficiency and reduced latency.
    
4.  Better support for mobile devices: IPv6 provides better support for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, which are increasingly becoming the primary way that people access the Internet. IPv6 provides a seamless, mobile-friendly experience for users.
    
5.  Improved network management: IPv6 provides improved network management capabilities, making it easier for network administrators to manage and maintain their networks.
