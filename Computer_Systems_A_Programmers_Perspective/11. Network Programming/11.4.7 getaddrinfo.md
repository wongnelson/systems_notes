### What are the getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions used for?

The `getaddrinfo` and `getnameinfo` functions are used for converting back and forth between binary socket address structures and the string representations of hostnames, host addresses, service names, and port numbers. They allow you to write network programs that are independent of any particular version of the IP protocol.
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
int getaddrinfo(const char *host, const char *service,
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **result);
```
### What are the arguments and return values of the getaddrinfo function?

The `getaddrinfo` function has the following arguments:

-   `host`: a domain name or a numeric address (e.g., a dotted-decimal IP address)
-   `service`: a service name (e.g., http) or a decimal port number
-   `hints`: an optional `addrinfo` structure that provides finer control over the list of socket addresses returned
-   `result`: a pointer to a linked list of `addrinfo` structures, each of which points to a socket address structure that corresponds to `host` and `service`

The function returns 0 if successful and a nonzero error code on error.

### What is the purpose of the addrinfo structure?

The `addrinfo` structure is used by the `getaddrinfo` function to store information about the socket addresses. It has fields for hints argument flags, arguments to the socket function, canonical hostname, size of the ai_addr structure, pointer to the socket address structure, and pointer to the next item in the linked list.

### How can you set up the addrinfo structure?

To set up the `addrinfo` structure, use `memset` to zero the entire structure and then set a few selected fields. You can set the `ai_family`, `ai_socktype`, `ai_protocol`, and `ai_flags` fields for finer control over the list of socket addresses returned by `getaddrinfo`.

### What are some useful ai_flags values in the addrinfo structure?

Some useful `ai_flags` values include:

-   AI_ADDRCONFIG: Returns IPv4 addresses only if the local host is configured for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses only if configured for IPv6.
-   AI_CANONNAME: Points the `ai_canonname` field in the first `addrinfo` structure in the list to the canonical (official) name of the host.
-   AI_NUMERICSERV: Forces the `service` argument to be a port number.
-   AI_PASSIVE: Returns socket addresses that can be used by servers as listening sockets, with the `host` argument set to NULL.

### How can you use getaddrinfo with the socket functions?

The fields in an `addrinfo` structure can be passed directly to the functions in the sockets interface without any further manipulation by the application code. For example, `ai_family`, `ai_socktype`, and `ai_protocol` can be passed directly to `socket`. Similarly, `ai_addr` and `ai_addrlen` can be passed directly to `connect` and `bind`. This property allows you to write clients and servers that are independent of any particular version of the IP protocol.

## Code example
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int main() {
  // host: a domain name or a numeric address (e.g., a dotted-decimal IP address)
  char *host = "www.example.com";
  // service: a service name (e.g., http) or a decimal port number
  char *service = "80";

  // hints: an optional addrinfo structure that provides finer control over the list of socket addresses returned
  struct addrinfo hints;
  memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);

  // Set a few selected fields in the addrinfo structure for finer control over the list of socket addresses returned by getaddrinfo
  hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
  hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

  // result: a pointer to a linked list of addrinfo structures, each of which points to a socket address structure that corresponds to host and service
  struct addrinfo *result;

  // Call getaddrinfo function to retrieve a linked list of addrinfo structures
  int status = getaddrinfo(host, service, &hints, &result);
  if (status != 0) {
    // Handle error if getaddrinfo returns a nonzero error code
  }

  // Use the fields in the first addrinfo structure to create a socket
  int sockfd = socket(result->ai_family, result->ai_socktype, result->ai_protocol);

  // Connect to the server using the fields in the first addrinfo structure
  status = connect(sockfd, result->ai_addr, result->ai_addrlen);
  if (status == -1) {
    // Handle error if connect returns -1
  }

  // Free the memory used by the linked list of addrinfo structures
  freeaddrinfo(result);

  // Use the connected socket for communication with the server
  // ...

  return 0;
}
