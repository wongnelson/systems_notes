## What is an HTTP Transaction?

An HTTP transaction is the process of a client requesting content from a web server and the server responding with the requested content. HTTP transactions use text lines transmitted over internet connections, making it possible to use programs like Linux telnet for conducting transactions with web servers.

## How do HTTP requests work?

An HTTP request consists of a request line, followed by zero or more request headers, and an empty text line that terminates the list of headers. A request line has the form:

`method URI version`

HTTP supports various methods, including GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, and TRACE. The GET method is the most common and instructs the server to generate and return the content identified by the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

Request headers provide additional information to the server, such as the browser's brand name or the MIME types that the browser understands. Request headers have the form:

`header-name: header-data`

## What is the Host header in HTTP requests?

The Host header is required in HTTP/1.1 requests but not in HTTP/1.0 requests. It is used by proxy caches, which sometimes serve as intermediaries between a browser and the origin server that manages the requested file. The data in the Host header allows a proxy in the middle of a proxy chain to determine if it might have a locally cached copy of the requested content.

## How do HTTP responses work?

HTTP responses are similar to HTTP requests. An HTTP response consists of a response line, followed by zero or more response headers, an empty line that terminates the headers, and the response body. A response line has the form:

`version status-code status-message`

The status-code is a three-digit positive integer that indicates the disposition of the request. The status-message gives the English equivalent of the error code.

## What are some common HTTP status codes?

Some common HTTP status codes include:

-   200 OK: Request was handled without error.
-   301 Moved Permanently: Content has moved to the hostname in the Location header.
-   400 Bad Request: Request could not be understood by the server.
-   403 Forbidden: Server lacks permission to access the requested file.
-   404 Not Found: Server could not find the requested file.
-   501 Not Implemented: Server does not support the request method.
-   505 HTTP Version Not Supported: Server does not support version in the request.

## What are the Content-Type and Content-Length headers in HTTP responses?

The Content-Type header tells the client the MIME type of the content in the response body, while the Content-Length header indicates its size in bytes.
