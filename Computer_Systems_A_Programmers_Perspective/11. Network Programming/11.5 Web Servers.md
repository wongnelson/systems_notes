## What is a Web Server?

A web server is a system that hosts and serves content over the internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Web servers are responsible for processing requests from web clients (typically browsers) and delivering the requested content, which can be HTML pages, images, or other types of files.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a text-based application-level protocol used for communication between web clients (browsers) and servers. A browser sends an HTTP request to a server, which then processes the request and responds with the desired content. The connection is closed after the content is delivered.

## What is the difference between Web services and file retrieval services like FTP?

Web services use HTTP and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create rich, interactive content that can be displayed in a browser. Unlike file retrieval services like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), web services can contain hyperlinks, embedded media, and other elements that make web pages more dynamic and engaging.
