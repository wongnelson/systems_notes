## What is the Client-Server Programming Model?

The Client-Server Programming Model is the basis for every network application. It consists of a server process and one or more client processes. The server manages a resource and provides a service to its clients by manipulating that resource. For example, a web server manages disk files that it retrieves and executes on behalf of clients.

## What are the four steps in a client-server transaction?

A client-server transaction consists of four steps:

1.  **Client sends a request**: When a client needs service, it initiates a transaction by sending a request to the server. For example, when a web browser needs a file, it sends a request to a web server.
    
2.  **Server processes the request**: The server receives the request, interprets it, and manipulates its resources in the appropriate way. For example, when a web server receives a request from a browser, it reads a disk file.
    
3.  **Server sends a response**: The server sends a response to the client and then waits for the next request. For example, a web server sends the file back to a client.
    
4.  **Client processes the response**: The client receives the response and manipulates it. For example, after a web browser receives a page from the server, it displays it on the screen.
    

## What is the difference between client-server transactions and database transactions?

Client-server transactions are not the same as database transactions and do not share any of their properties, such as atomicity. In the context of the client-server model, a transaction is simply a sequence of steps carried out by a client and a server.

## Can clients and servers be processes or hosts?

Clients and servers are processes and not machines or hosts as they are often called in this context. A single host can run many different clients and servers concurrently, and a client and server transaction can be on the same or different hosts. The client-server model is the same, regardless of the mapping of clients and servers to hosts.
