### What is a socket from the perspective of the Linux kernel and a Linux program?

From the perspective of the Linux kernel, a socket is an endpoint for communication. From the perspective of a Linux program, a socket is an open file with a corresponding descriptor.

### What are Internet socket addresses stored in?

Internet socket addresses are stored in 16-byte structures having the type `sockaddr_in`.

### What was the solution used by the designers of the sockets interface for the connect, bind, and accept functions?

The designers of the sockets interface defined sockets functions to expect a pointer to a generic `sockaddr` structure and then required applications to cast any pointers to protocol-specific structures to this generic structure. This was done because the generic `void *` pointer, which is common today, did not exist in C at that time.

```c
struct sockaddr_in serveraddr; 
struct sockaddr *ptr_serveraddr = (struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr;
```

### How do you simplify casting a `sockaddr_in` structure to a generic `sockaddr` structure in code examples?

To simplify code examples, you can follow Stevens's lead and define the following type:
`typedef struct sockaddr SA;`
Then, use this type whenever you need to cast a `sockaddr_in` structure to a generic `sockaddr` structure.
