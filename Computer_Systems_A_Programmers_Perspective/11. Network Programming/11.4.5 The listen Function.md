### What is the purpose of the `listen` function?

The `listen` function is used by servers to tell the kernel that the socket descriptor will be used by a server instead of a client. It converts the socket descriptor from an active socket to a listening socket that can accept connection requests from clients.

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```
### What are the arguments of the `listen` function?

The `listen` function has the following arguments:

-   `sockfd`: the socket descriptor to be converted to a listening socket
-   `backlog`: a hint about the number of outstanding connection requests that the kernel should queue up before it starts to refuse requests

### What does the `listen` function return?

The `listen` function returns `0` if successful and `-1` on error.

### How is the backlog argument typically set in the `listen` function?

The backlog argument is typically set to a large value, such as 1,024, to allow the kernel to queue up a sufficient number of outstanding connection requests before refusing requests.

### What are the roles of the listening and connected descriptors?
![[Pasted image 20230415115304.png]]
Figure 11.14 illustrates the three roles of the listening and connected descriptors:

1.  The listening descriptor is used by the server to accept new connection requests from clients.
2.  The connected descriptor is used by the server to communicate with a specific client after a connection is established.
3.  The connected descriptor is used by the client to communicate with the server after a connection is established.

## Code example
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int serverfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    if (serverfd == -1) {
        perror("socket error");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use the listen function to convert the socket descriptor to a listening socket
    // The first argument is the socket descriptor to be converted to a listening socket
    // The second argument is a hint about the number of outstanding connection requests that the kernel should queue up before it starts to refuse requests
    // The backlog argument is typically set to a large value, such as 1,024, to allow the kernel to queue up a sufficient number of outstanding connection requests before refusing requests
    int result = listen(serverfd, 1024);

    if (result == -1) {
        perror("listen error");
        return 1;
    }

    // Accept incoming connections
    // The accept function is used to accept incoming connections on the socket
    // The first argument is the socket file descriptor
    // The second argument is a pointer to a socket address structure for the client address, which can be used to identify the client
    // The third argument is a pointer to the size of the socket address structure, which must be initialized before calling accept
    struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
    socklen_t client_addr_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    int clientfd = accept(serverfd, (struct sockaddr*) &client_addr, &client_addr_len);

    // Check if a connection was accepted successfully
    // The accept function returns the socket file descriptor for the new connection on success, and -1 on error
    // The perror function is used to print an error message indicating the cause of the error
    if (clientfd == -1) {
        perror("accept error");
        return 1;
    }

    // Close the socket
    // The close function is used to close a socket
    // The argument is the socket file descriptor
    close(serverfd);
    close(clientfd);

    // Exit the program
    return 0;
}
```
This example shows how to use the listen function in a server program to convert the socket descriptor to a listening socket and accept incoming connections. The comments for each line of code provide detailed rationale for why the code was written in the way it was.
