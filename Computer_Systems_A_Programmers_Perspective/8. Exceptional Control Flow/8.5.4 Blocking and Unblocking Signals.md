**Q:** What are the two mechanisms for blocking signals in Linux?  
**A:** Linux provides two mechanisms for blocking signals: Implicit and Explicit.

**Q:**<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> What is the Implicit blocking mechanism?  </mark>
**A:** By default, the kernel blocks any pending signals of the type currently being processed by a handler. For example, if a program has caught signal s and is currently running handler S, and another signal s is sent to the process, then s will become pending but will not be received until after handler S returns.

**Q:** What is the Explicit blocking mechanism?  
**A:** Applications can explicitly block and unblock selected signals using the `sigprocmask` function and its helpers.

**Q:** What is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the `sigprocmask`</mark> function?  
**A:** The `sigprocmask` function is used to change the set of currently blocked signals. Its prototype is:
```c
#include <signal.h>

int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *set, sigset_t *oldset);
```
The specific behavior of `sigprocmask` depends on the value of `how` parameter:

-   `SIG_BLOCK`: Adds the signals in `set` to blocked signals.
-   `SIG_UNBLOCK`: Removes the signals in `set` from blocked signals.
-   `SIG_SETMASK`: Sets blocked signals to `set`.

If `oldset` is non-NULL, the previous value of the blocked bit vector is stored in `oldset`.

**Q:** What are the helper functions used to manipulate signal sets?  
**A:** The following functions are used to manipulate signal sets:

-   `sigemptyset`: Initializes set to the empty set.
-   `sigfillset`: Adds every signal to set.
-   `sigaddset`: Adds a specific signal to set.
-   `sigdelset`: Deletes a specific signal from set.
-   `sigismember`: Returns 1 if a signal is a member of set, and 0 if not.

**Q:** How can we use `sigprocmask` to temporarily block a signal?  
**A:** you would use `sigprocmask` to temporarily block the receipt of `SIGINT` signals.

```c
1	sigset_t mask, prev_mask;
2	
3	Sigemptyset(&mask);
4	Sigaddset(&mask, SIGINT);
5	
6	/* Block SIGINT and save previous blocked set */
7	Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &prev_mask);
8	â‹® // Code region that will not be interrupted by SIGINT
9	/* Restore previous blocked set, unblocking SIGINT */
10	Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_mask, NULL);
11	
```
In this example, we create a signal set `mask` using `sigset_t`. We then initialize the set to empty using `sigemptyset` and add the `SIGINT` signal to the set using `sigaddset`.

We then use `sigprocmask` to block the `SIGINT` signal and save the previous blocked set in `prev_mask` using `SIG_BLOCK`. We can then execute a code region that will not be interrupted by `SIGINT`.

Finally, we use `sigprocmask` to restore the previous blocked set and unblock `SIGINT` using `SIG_SETMASK`.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>
Let's say we have a program that catches the SIGINT signal and has a signal handler registered to handle it. The signal handler simply prints a message to the console and then returns.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void sigint_handler(int signum) {
  printf("Caught SIGINT signal\n");
}

int main() {
  struct sigaction sa;
  sa.sa_handler = sigint_handler;
  sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL);

  while (1) {
    // do some work
  }

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, the program registers the `sigint_handler` function to handle the `SIGINT` signal using the `sigaction` function. Then, the program enters an infinite loop and does some work.

Now let's assume that while the program is running and `sigint_handler` is currently being executed, another `SIGINT` signal is sent to the process. In this case, the kernel will block the second `SIGINT` signal until `sigint_handler` returns. Once `sigint_handler` returns, the second `SIGINT` signal will be delivered to the process and the signal handler will be invoked again.

This behavior is important because it ensures that signals are not lost or overwritten by other signals while a signal handler is currently executing. It also allows programs to safely perform actions that might be interrupted by signals without worrying about inconsistent state or unexpected behavior.

**q: what is the sigaction struct?**
a; The `sigaction` struct is a data structure used in Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems) to specify the behavior of a signal when it is received by a process. It is used in conjunction with the `sigaction` system call to install a signal handler for a particular signal.

Here is the definition of the `sigaction` struct, as specified in the `signal.h` header file:
```c
struct sigaction {
  void (*sa_handler)(int);
  void (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
  sigset_t sa_mask;
  int sa_flags;
  void (*sa_restorer)(void);
};
```
Let's break down each field of the `sigaction` struct:

-   `sa_handler`: This field specifies the action to be taken when the signal is received. It can either be a function pointer to a signal handler function, or the value `SIG_IGN` to ignore the signal, or the value `SIG_DFL` to use the default behavior for the signal.
-   `sa_sigaction`: This field specifies an alternative signal handler function to be used for signals that provide additional information (such as `SIGSEGV` or `SIGILL`). This field is typically not used in conjunction with `sa_handler`.
-   `sa_mask`: This field specifies the set of signals that should be blocked while the signal handler is executing. This is useful for ensuring that the signal handler is not interrupted by other signals.
-   `sa_flags`: This field specifies various flags that control the behavior of the signal. For example, the `SA_RESTART` flag can be used to automatically restart system calls that were interrupted by the signal.
-   `sa_restorer`: This field is used internally by the kernel to restore the process's signal mask after the signal handler has finished executing.

When `sigaction` is called with a pointer to a `sigaction` struct, it installs the specified signal handler for the specified signal, and returns the previous signal handler (if any).

## Sigprocmask
### What is the purpose of the `sigprocmask` function?

The `sigprocmask` function is used to manipulate the process-level signal mask, which determines which signals are blocked or unblocked for the entire process. 

### Why is the signal mask used in Unix-like operating systems?

In Unix-like operating systems, signals are delivered to processes asynchronously, meaning that a process can receive a signal at any time while it is running. The signal mask allows control over which signals a process is currently blocking or unblocking. When a signal is blocked, it is not immediately delivered to the process but instead placed in a queue to be delivered later when the signal is unblocked.

### What does the process-level signal mask represent?

The process-level signal mask is a set of signals that are either blocked or unblocked for a given process. It is implemented as a bit vector, where each bit corresponds to a specific signal number. If a bit is set to 1, it indicates that the corresponding signal is blocked for the process, meaning that the signal will not be delivered until it is unblocked. Conversely, if a bit is set to 0, it indicates that the corresponding signal is unblocked for the process, allowing the signal to be delivered.
Here's an example to illustrate how the signal mask is implemented as a bit vector:

Suppose we have a process P that has three signals in its signal mask: SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, and SIGINT. We can represent the signal mask as a 3-bit vector, where each bit corresponds to a particular signal number:

```c
     Signal mask:    0 1 1
                     | | |
                     | | +-- SIGINT
                     | +---- SIGUSR2
                     +------ SIGUSR1
```
In this example, the bit for SIGUSR1 is set to 1, which means that SIGUSR1 is blocked for the process. The bits for SIGUSR2 and SIGINT are set to 0, which means that they are unblocked.

`SIGUSR1` is a user-defined signal that can be used by applications to signal other processes or threads. This signal has no predefined meaning, and its use is entirely up to the application.

In POSIX-compliant operating systems such as Linux, `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` are two signals that are reserved for user-defined purposes. They can be used by applications to communicate with other processes or threads or to interrupt a running process for a specific task.

Applications can send `SIGUSR1` signal to another process or thread using the `kill()` system call. The receiving process or thread can catch the signal using `sigaction()` or `signal()` system call and perform an action based on the application's defined signal handler.

If a signal is blocked for a process, it will not be delivered to the process until it is unblocked. For example, suppose that the process P is currently executing a critical section of code that must not be interrupted by any signals. It can use `sigprocmask` to temporarily block all signals, including SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, and SIGINT:
```c
sigset_t mask, oldmask;
sigfillset(&mask);     // Block all signals
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &oldmask);    // Save old signal mask and set new mask
// Critical section of code that must not be interrupted
sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oldmask, NULL);   // Restore old signal mask
```
In this example, the `sigprocmask` function is used to block all signals by setting all bits in the signal mask to 1. The old signal mask is saved in the `oldmask` variable so that it can be restored later. The critical section of code is then executed, knowing that no signals will be delivered to the process during this time. Finally, the old signal mask is restored by calling `sigprocmask` again with the `SIG_SETMASK` flag and passing `NULL` as the third argument, indicating that we don't need to save the old signal mask anymore.

This is just a simple example, but it illustrates how the signal mask can be used to control which signals are delivered to a process at any given time. By manipulating the signal mask using functions like `sigprocmask`, `sigaddset`, `sigdelset`, and `sigismember`, processes can choose which signals they want to handle and when they want to handle them.

### How does the `sigprocmask` function manipulate the signal mask?

The `sigprocmask` function is used to modify the process-level signal mask. It provides the ability to add or remove signals from the signal mask, effectively blocking or unblocking signals for the process. The function takes parameters specifying the set of signals to be added or removed from the mask and allows for manipulation of the signal mask based on the desired blocking or unblocking requirements.

### What are the consequences of blocking a signal?

When a signal is blocked for a process, it will not be delivered to that process until it is unblocked. This means that the process will not immediately receive or handle the blocked signal, and the signal will be held in a queue until it is unblocked. Blocking signals can be useful in scenarios where the process needs to temporarily prevent the delivery of certain signals, such as during critical sections of code or when specific signal handling is not desired at a particular time.
