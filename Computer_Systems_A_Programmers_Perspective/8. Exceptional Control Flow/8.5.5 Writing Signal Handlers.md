## What is signal handling in Linux?

Signal handling is the process by which a Linux process can be notified of asynchronous events, such as a keyboard interrupt or an alarm clock. Signals are software interrupts that are sent to a process to notify it of a particular event.

In Linux, signals are handled by the kernel, which is responsible for delivering signals to the appropriate process. When a signal is delivered to a process, it interrupts the normal flow of execution and causes the kernel to jump to a predefined signal handler function.

## Why is signal handling important in Linux system-level programming?

Signal handling is important in Linux system-level programming because it allows a process to react to external events without having to constantly poll for them. Instead, the process can continue executing normally and be notified when an event occurs. This can make the process more efficient and reduce resource usage.

Additionally, signals are used for a variety of important tasks in Linux, such as process management, debugging, and error handling. As such, understanding how to handle signals correctly is crucial for writing safe, correct, and portable code.

## What are the challenges of signal handling in Linux system-level programming?

There are several challenges associated with signal handling in Linux system-level programming.

First, signal handlers run concurrently with the main program and share the same global variables. This can lead to race conditions and other issues if not handled properly.

Second, the rules for how and when signals are received can be counterintuitive. For example, a signal may be blocked for a certain period of time or may be received by a process at an unexpected time.

Finally, different systems can have different signal-handling semantics, which can lead to portability issues if not taken into account.

## Safe Signal Handling
Q: Why are signal handlers tricky?

A: Signal handlers are tricky because they can run concurrently with the main program and with each other. If a handler and the main program access the same global data structure concurrently, then the results can be unpredictable and often fatal.

Suppose you have a program that contains a global variable `counter` and a signal handler for SIGINT that increments `counter` by one every time the signal is received. If the main program is also accessing `counter` at the same time, then there could be race conditions where the signal handler and the main program are both attempting to read and write to `counter` at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.

Here's an example of how this could happen:
```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

volatile int counter = 0;

void sigint_handler(int sig) {
    counter++;
}

int main() {
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = sigint_handler;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL);

    while (1) {
        printf("Counter: %d\n", counter);
        sleep(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `sigint_handler` function increments `counter` every time the SIGINT signal is received. Meanwhile, the main program is continuously printing out the value of `counter`. If SIGINT is received while the main program is accessing `counter`, then the handler and the main program will both try to modify the value of `counter` at the same time, leading to unpredictable behavior. To avoid this, it's important to ensure that access to shared resources is properly synchronized.

In the given code, pressing the Ctrl+C key combination on the terminal while the program is running would trigger the SIGINT signal.

### What are the basic guidelines for writing safe, correct, and portable signal handlers?

Here are some basic guidelines for writing safe, correct, and portable signal handlers in Linux:

1.  Keep signal handlers short and simple: Signal handlers should perform only minimal tasks, such as setting a flag or waking up another thread, and should return as quickly as possible.
    
2.  Avoid using library functions in signal handlers: Signal handlers should avoid calling library functions, as many library functions are not reentrant and can cause race conditions or other issues.
    
3.  Use the volatile qualifier for variables shared by signal handlers and the main program: The volatile qualifier tells the compiler that a variable may be changed by external events, such as a signal handler, and should not be optimized.
    
4.  Use the sigaction function instead of signal: The sigaction function provides more fine-grained control over signal handling, including the ability to block signals during the execution of the signal handler.
    
5.  Always check the return values of system calls: System calls can fail for a variety of reasons, and it is important to check their return values to ensure that the program is behaving as expected.
    
6.  Use the sigprocmask function to manipulate signal masks: The sigprocmask function can be used to add or remove signals from the signal mask of a process, allowing for fine-grained control over which signals are delivered to the process.
    
7.  Use portable signal numbers: Different systems can have different signal numbers for the same signal, so it is important to use the portable signal number constants defined in the signal.h header file.

Q: Why is it important to keep handlers simple?

A: The best way to avoid trouble is to keep your handlers as small and simple as possible. This helps to reduce the chances of introducing subtle concurrency errors, which are often difficult to debug. By keeping handlers simple, you can reduce the risk of unpredictable and unrepeatable failures.
Here is an example of a simple signal handler:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

volatile sig_atomic_t flag = 0;

void handler(int sig)
{
    flag = 1;
}

int main()
{
    signal(SIGUSR1, handler);
    printf("Waiting for SIGUSR1...\n");
    while (!flag);
    printf("Received SIGUSR1!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
This program sets up a handler for the `SIGUSR1` signal, which simply sets a global flag and returns immediately. The main program then waits for the flag to be set before continuing. This is an example of the guideline to keep handlers simple and small. The handler does not perform any complex processing or access any global data structures, reducing the risk of subtle concurrency errors. By keeping the handler simple, we can reduce the risk of unpredictable and unrepeatable failures.

Here's a "non-simple" example:
```c
void handler(int sig) {
    printf("Signal %d received\n", sig);
    // do some complicated work that involves accessing global data structures and calling non-signal-safe functions
}
```
In this example, the signal handler does more than just set a flag or perform a simple action. Instead, it does some complicated work that may involve accessing global data structures and calling non-signal-safe functions (e.g., `printf`). This increases the risk of introducing subtle concurrency errors, which are often difficult to debug. For example, if the main program is also accessing the same global data structures, it may cause a race condition that leads to unpredictable and unrepeatable failures.

By keeping handlers simple, you can reduce the risk of such errors. Instead of doing complicated work in the signal handler, you can set a flag or perform a simple action, and let the main program handle the rest of the processing. This helps to ensure that the signal handler does not interfere with the main program or with other signal handlers, and reduces the risk of unpredictable and unrepeatable failures.

Q: What is an async-signal-safe function?

A: An async-signal-safe function is a function that can be safely called from a signal handler, either because it is reentrant or because it cannot be interrupted by a signal handler. A function that is reentrant is one that does not access global data, and instead only accesses local data. This ensures that the function can be safely called multiple times concurrently without interfering with other calls.

Q: Why is it important to call only async-signal-safe functions in signal handlers?

A: It is important to call only async-signal-safe functions in signal handlers because calling non-safe functions can result in undefined behavior due to the concurrent nature of signal handling. Functions that are not async-signal-safe may not be able to handle being interrupted by a signal handler, leading to unpredictable behavior.

Q: What are some examples of async-signal-safe functions?

A: Examples of async-signal-safe functions include read, write, getpid, malloc, free, and many others. The list of guaranteed async-signal-safe functions is system-dependent and can be found in the documentation.

Q: What is the Sio package (developed for the book)?

A: The Sio (Safe I/O) package is a set of functions that can be used to print simple messages from signal handlers. These functions are designed to be safe to use in signal handlers, unlike many other I/O functions such as printf and sprintf, which are not async-signal-safe. The Sio package provides a safe alternative for generating output from signal handlers.

### Q1: What are the sio_putl and sio_puts functions?

A1: The `sio_putl` and `sio_puts` functions are part of the Safe I/O (Sio) package for signal handlers. The `sio_putl` function emits a long to the standard output, while the `sio_puts` function emits a string to the standard output.

sio_putl example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "sio.h"

int main() {
    long myNum = 123456789;
    sio_putl(myNum, stdout);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we include the "stdio.h" header file for standard I/O functions and the "sio.h" header file for the "sio_putl" function. We declare a variable "myNum" of type "long" and assign it the value 123456789. We then use "sio_putl" to print "myNum" to the standard output stream "stdout".

### Q2: What does the sio_error function do?

A2: The `sio_error` function prints an error message and terminates the program.

### Q6: What is the purpose of saving and restoring errno in a signal handler?

A6: Many of the Linux async-signal-safe functions set `errno` when they return with an error. Calling such functions inside a handler might interfere with other parts of the program that rely on `errno`. Therefore, it is important to save and restore the `errno` value around calls to such functions in a signal handler. This ensures that the value of `errno` is not lost or corrupted, and that the program can continue to function correctly.

### Q7: What is the safe version of the SIGINT handler?

A7: Figure 8.35 shows a safe version of the SIGINT handler, which uses the Sio package for safe I/O operations and saves and restores the `errno` value around calls to `write` function. The handler terminates the program safely and reliably using `_exit` function.
```c
#include "csapp.h"

void sigint_handler(int sig) /* Safe SIGINT handler */
{
    int olderrno = errno;
    Sio_puts("Caught SIGINT!\n"); /* Safe output */
    errno = olderrno;
    _exit(0); /* Safe exit */
}
```

Q3. Why should global variables be declared with volatile when used by signal handlers?

A: Global variables should be declared with the volatile type qualifier when used by signal handlers to prevent optimization by the compiler that may result in incorrect behavior. If a handler and a main routine share a global variable, and the handler updates the variable while the main routine periodically reads it, the compiler may optimize the main routine's code by caching the variable in a register. This optimization may result in the main routine not seeing the updated values from the handler. Declaring the variable with the volatile qualifier forces the compiler to read the value of the variable from memory each time it is referenced in the code.


Q4. Why should flags be declared with sig_atomic_t when shared between a handler and a main program?

A: Flags should be declared with sig_atomic_t when shared between a handler and a main program because this data type guarantees that reads and writes are atomic and uninterruptible. In one common handler design, the handler records the receipt of the signal by writing to a global flag. The main program periodically reads the flag, responds to the signal, and clears the flag. The sig_atomic_t data type provides an integer data type for which reads and writes are guaranteed to be atomic because they can be implemented with a single instruction. This means that reads and writes to the flag can be safely performed without temporarily blocking signals.

Here's an example of using `sig_atomic_t` to share a flag between a signal handler and a main program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>

volatile sig_atomic_t flag = 0;

void handler(int sig) {
    flag = 1;
}

int main(void) {
    // Register the signal handler for SIGUSR1
    if (signal(SIGUSR1, handler) == SIG_ERR) {
        perror("signal");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Main loop to periodically check the flag
    while (1) {
        if (flag) {
            printf("Received SIGUSR1 signal!\n");
            flag = 0;
        }

        // Do some other work here
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we declare a global flag variable `flag` of type `sig_atomic_t`. The signal handler for `SIGUSR1` simply sets the flag to 1. Meanwhile, the main program periodically checks the flag, and if it is set, responds to the signal by printing a message to the console and resetting the flag to 0.

The condition `signal(SIGUSR1, handler) == SIG_ERR` would trigger if the attempt to set up the signal handler for the `SIGUSR1` signal fails. This could happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the process does not have permission to handle signals, or if the signal is not valid on the current platform.

In practice, it is a good idea to always check the return value of `signal()` to ensure that the signal handler was properly installed. If the return value is `SIG_ERR`, the program can print an error message or take other appropriate action to handle the failure.

The use of `sig_atomic_t` ensures that the read and write operations on the flag are atomic and uninterruptible, even if a signal handler interrupts the main program while it is reading or writing the flag. This means that we don't need to temporarily block signals while accessing the flag, as we would with a regular integer variable.

## Correct Signal Handling
You should probably read this section
### How does the pending signal bit vector work, and why is it important to understand its limitations?

The pending signal bit vector contains one bit for each type of signal, indicating whether a signal of that type has been received but not yet processed. When a signal is received, its bit is set in the pending signal bit vector. The signal handler can then examine the bit vector to determine which signals are pending and take appropriate actions.

It is important to understand the limitations of the pending signal bit vector because it can lead to non-intuitive behavior. Specifically, if a process receives multiple signals of the same type while a signal handler for that type is currently executing, only one of the signals will be processed, and the rest will be discarded. This behavior can result in lost signals.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

volatile sig_atomic_t signal_count = 0;

void signal_handler(int signum) {
    signal_count++;
    printf("Received signal %d\n", signum);
}

int main() {
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = signal_handler;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;

    // Install the signal handler
    sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL);

    // Send multiple signals
    printf("Sending signal SIGUSR1\n");
    kill(getpid(), SIGUSR1);
    sleep(1);  // Wait for signal handler to finish
    kill(getpid(), SIGUSR1);
    sleep(1);  // Wait for signal handler to finish
    kill(getpid(), SIGUSR1);

    printf("Received %d signals\n", signal_count);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the program installs a signal handler for the `SIGUSR1` signal and sends three signals to itself using the `kill` function. Each signal should trigger the signal handler, which increments the `signal_count` variable and prints a message indicating which signal was received.

However, because multiple signals are being sent while the signal handler is still executing, only one of the signals will actually be processed, and the rest will be discarded. This can result in lost signals, which can be observed in the output of the program:
```c
Sending signal SIGUSR1
Received signal 10
Received 1 signals
```
As you can see, only one signal was processed, even though three signals were sent. This is because the pending signal bit vector only has room for one pending signal of each type. When multiple signals of the same type are received while a signal handler for that type is already executing, only one of the signals is added to the pending signal bit vector, and the rest are discarded. This behavior can be non-intuitive and can lead to lost signals if not properly accounted for in the program's design.

### What is a zombie process, and how can signal handling be used to prevent them?

A zombie process is a process that has terminated but has not yet been reaped by its parent. When a process terminates, its resources (such as memory and file descriptors) are released, but its process descriptor remains in the process table until the parent reaps it. A zombie process is not harmful in itself, but a large number of zombies can cause problems by filling up the process table.

Signal handling can be used to prevent zombie processes by having the parent process catch the SIGCHLD signal, which is sent by the kernel to the parent when one of its children terminates or stops. When the parent catches the SIGCHLD signal, it can use the wait() system call to reap the child process and release its process descriptor.

code that demonstrates signal handling to prevent zombie processes:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

void sigchld_handler(int sig) {
    // Handler for SIGCHLD signal, which is sent by the kernel to the parent when one of its children terminates or stops.
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

    // Use a loop to reap all child processes that have terminated or stopped.
    while ((pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG)) > 0) {
        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child process %d terminated normally with exit status %d\n", pid, WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else if (WIFSIGNALED(status)) {
            printf("Child process %d terminated by signal %d\n", pid, WTERMSIG(status));
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    pid_t pid;

    // Register the SIGCHLD signal handler with the parent process.
    signal(SIGCHLD, sigchld_handler);

    // Create a child process.
    pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process running\n");
        sleep(5);
        printf("Child process exiting\n");
        exit(0);
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process running\n");
        // The parent process waits for the child process to terminate.
        // If the parent process exits before the child process, the child process becomes a zombie process.
        wait(NULL);
        printf("Parent process exiting\n");
        exit(0);
    } else {
        // Error
        perror("fork");
        exit(1);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

-   Lines 6-15 define the signal handler function for SIGCHLD. When the parent process catches the SIGCHLD signal, this handler is called. The `waitpid()` function is used to reap all child processes that have terminated or stopped. The `WNOHANG` option is used to return immediately if there are no child processes waiting to be reaped.
    
-   Line 21 registers the SIGCHLD signal handler with the parent process using the `signal()` function.
    
-   Lines 24-39 create a child process and a parent process. The parent process waits for the child process to terminate using the `wait()` system call. If the parent process exits before the child process, the child process becomes a zombie process.
    
-   Lines 8-14 and 31-36 print messages to the console to indicate the status of the child process. If the child process terminated normally, the exit status is printed. If the child process was terminated by a signal, the signal number is printed.
    

By using signal handling to reap child processes, we can prevent zombie processes and ensure that all resources allocated by child processes are properly released.

### Practice Problem 8.8
What is the output of the following program?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_code/ecf/signalprob0.c_

```c

1	volatile long counter = 2;
2	
3	void handler1(int sig)
4	{
5		sigset_t mask, prev_mask;
6	
7		Sigfillset(&mask);
8		Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &prev_mask); /* Block sigs */
9		Sio_putl(--counter);
10		Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_mask, NULL); /* Restore sigs */
11	
12		_exit(0);
13	}
14
15	int main()
16	{
17		pid_t pid;
18		sigset_t mask, prev_mask;
19	
20		printf ("%ld", counter);
21		fflush(stdout);
22	
23		signal(SIGUSR1, handler1);
24		if ((pid = Fork()) == 0) {
25			while (1) ();
26		}
27		Kill(pid, SIGUSR1);
28		Waitpid(-1, NULL, 0);
29	
30		Sigfillset(&mask);
31		Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &prev_mask); /* Block sigs */
32		printf ("%ld", ++counter);
33		Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_mask, NULL); /* Restore sigs */
34	
35		exit(0);
36	}
```
So, the program starts by printing `2`. It then forks a child process, which spins in an infinite loop. The parent process sends a `SIGUSR1` signal to the child process, which interrupts the infinite loop and executes the `handler1` signal handler function. The `handler1` function decrements the global variable `counter` and prints `1`, then terminates. The parent process waits for the child process to terminate, which it does when it receives the `SIGUSR1` signal and executes the signal handler function. After the child process terminates, the parent process increments the global variable `counter` and prints `3`. Finally, the parent process terminates. So the final output of the program is `21`

### Sigaction
Q: What is the sigaction function and why is it important? A: The sigaction function is a system call in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to specify the signal-handling semantics they want when they install a signal handler. It is important because it provides a portable way to specify how signals should be handled, including whether they should be blocked or not, whether system calls should be restarted or not, and what action should be taken when a signal is received.

Q: What is the syntax and return value of the sigaction function? A: The sigaction function has the following syntax:
```c
#include <signal.h>
int sigaction(int signum, struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact);
```
The function returns 0 if it is successful, and -1 if there is an error.

Q: What is the Signal wrapper function and why is it used? A: The Signal wrapper function is a utility function that simplifies the process of installing signal handlers by calling the sigaction function for us. It is used because the sigaction function is unwieldy and requires the user to set the entries of a complicated structure. The Signal wrapper function provides a cleaner and more intuitive way to install signal handlers.

Q: What are the signal-handling semantics of the Signal wrapper function? A: The Signal wrapper function installs a signal handler with the following signal-handling semantics:

-   Only signals of the type currently being processed by the handler are blocked.
-   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">As with all signal implementations, signals are not queued.</mark>
-   Interrupted system calls are automatically restarted whenever possible.
-   Once the signal handler is installed, it remains installed until Signal is called with a handler argument of either SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL.

Q: How is the Signal wrapper function invoked? A: The Signal wrapper function is invoked in the same way as the signal function. The syntax is:
```c
typedef void handler_t(int);
handler_t *Signal(int signum, handler_t *handler);
```
The function takes two arguments: the signal number (signum) and a pointer to the signal handler function (handler). The return value of the Signal function is a pointer to the previous signal handler for the specified signal.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>
When a process receives a signal, the kernel sends a notification to the process indicating that the signal has arrived. However, if the process is already handling a signal when another signal arrives, the second signal is not queued. Instead, the process may lose the second signal entirely or the second signal may be merged with the first signal to produce a composite signal.

For example, suppose a process is handling a `SIGUSR1` signal and another `SIGUSR1` signal arrives before the first signal handler completes. If signals were queued, the second `SIGUSR1` signal would be enqueued and delivered to the process once the first signal handler completes. However, since signals are not queued, the second `SIGUSR1` signal is either lost or merged with the first signal, depending on the signal-handling semantics in place.

Therefore, when writing signal handlers, it's important to make sure that they are designed to handle multiple signals that may be received concurrently. In some cases, it may be necessary to use additional synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes to ensure that signal handlers are executed atomically.
