### Q: What is concurrency and why is it important to understand in programming?

Concurrency is the ability of a computer system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. In programming, concurrency is important because many modern systems and applications require the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in order to be efficient and responsive. Understanding concurrency is important for writing programs that are efficient, reliable, and free from bugs related to concurrent execution.

### Q: What is a race condition and how can it cause bugs in concurrent programs?

A race condition is a type of concurrency bug that can occur when two or more threads or processes access shared data and attempt to modify it at the same time. The order in which these modifications occur can be unpredictable, and can lead to unexpected results or program crashes. Race conditions can be difficult to detect and reproduce, and they can cause programs to behave incorrectly or crash under certain conditions.

### Q: What is synchronization in concurrent programming and why is it important?

Synchronization is the process of coordinating the execution of concurrent threads or processes in order to avoid race conditions and ensure that shared data is accessed and modified correctly. Synchronization is important in concurrent programming because it helps ensure that concurrent operations are performed in the correct order, and that shared data is accessed and modified atomically (i.e., as a single, indivisible operation). Without proper synchronization, concurrent programs can exhibit race conditions and other types of bugs related to concurrent execution.

### Q: Can you provide an example of a synchronization error in a concurrent program?

One example of a synchronization error is a race condition that can occur in a program that maintains a global data structure, such as a linked list or hash table, and allows multiple threads or processes to modify the structure concurrently. If two threads attempt to modify the same node in the data structure at the same time, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the changes made by the other thread, leading to incorrect or inconsistent data.

### Q: How can exceptional control flow be used to help address synchronization errors in concurrent programming?

Exceptional control flow, such as signal handling in Unix-based systems, can be used to coordinate the execution of concurrent threads or processes in order to avoid race conditions and ensure that shared data is accessed and modified correctly. For example, in the Unix shell program discussed in the original content, the parent process uses a signal handler to handle the termination of child processes and remove them from the job list. By using a signal handler, the parent process can ensure that the removal of child processes from the job list is coordinated with the termination of the child processes, thus avoiding race conditions and synchronization errors.

### Q: What's the job list?
The job list is a data structure used in Unix-based operating systems to keep track of running jobs or processes in the system. Typically, it's used by shell or job control programs to manage processes that are started by the user or the system.

The job list can be implemented in various ways, but it usually contains information about each job, such as its process ID (PID), status, command, and other relevant data. Here's an example of what the job list might look like:
```ruby
Job ID  PID   Status     Command
1       1234  Running    ./myprog
2       5678  Stopped    vim file.txt
3       9101  Done       gcc -o myprog myprog.c
```
To modify the job list in code, you can use the functions `addjob` and `deletejob`.

`addjob` function adds a new job to the job list. The job structure stores information about a child process, including its process ID, status, and command line. Here's an example of how you might use `addjob` to add a new job to the list:
```c
pid_t pid = Fork(); /* Create a new child process */
if (pid == 0) {
    /* Child process */
    Execve("/bin/date", argv, NULL);
} else {
    /* Parent process */
    Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_all, &prev_all); /* Block signals */
    addjob(pid); /* Add the child to the job list */
    Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_all, NULL); /* Restore signal mask */
}
```
### What happens if you dont explicitly add the job?
If you don't explicitly add the job to the job list, the parent process will lose track of the child process and won't be able to manage its status effectively. This can lead to various issues, including:

1.  Zombie processes: If the parent process does not add the child process to the job list, it won't receive notifications about the child's termination. As a result, the child process may become a "zombie" process. Zombie processes are terminated child processes that still have an entry in the process table, consuming system resources. They need to be properly reaped by the parent process using system calls like `wait()` or `waitpid()`.
    
2.  Inability to manage the child process: By adding the child process to the job list, the parent process can keep track of its status, including whether it has completed, stopped, or terminated. This allows the parent process to perform appropriate actions, such as cleaning up resources associated with the child process, handling errors, or monitoring its progress.
    
3.  Lack of synchronization and coordination: The job list serves as a mechanism for the parent process to synchronize and coordinate with its child processes. Without adding the job to the list, the parent process won't have a centralized way to manage and communicate with its child processes effectively. This can lead to coordination issues, incorrect sequencing of operations, or difficulty in implementing desired behaviors.
    

Overall, explicitly adding the job to the job list allows the parent process to maintain control and visibility over its child processes. It facilitates proper management, synchronization, and coordination, while avoiding potential problems like zombie processes and the loss of child process tracking.

### Delete job
`deletejob` function removes a job from the job list given its process ID. Here's an example of how you might use `deletejob` to remove a job from the list:
```c
pid_t pid = ... /* Process ID of the job to remove */
Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_all, &prev_all); /* Block signals */
deletejob(pid); /* Remove the job from the job list */
Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_all, NULL); /* Restore signal mask */
```
Note that `addjob` and `deletejob` are often called from within the `handler` function that is registered to handle the `SIGCHLD` signal. This is because the `SIGCHLD` signal is sent to the parent process when a child process changes state (such as when it terminates). The signal handler can then update the job list to reflect the new state of the child process.

### Q: Why do you block all signals before adding/modifying a child to job list?

Blocking all signals before adding a child to the job list is done to ensure that the job list is updated atomically and cannot be interrupted by a signal handler.

When the parent process adds a child to the job list, it modifies shared data structures that could also be modified by a signal handler that runs concurrently. This can lead to race conditions and result in inconsistent data structures or even crashes. To avoid such issues, the parent blocks all signals using `Sigprocmask` before adding a child to the job list. This ensures that the signal handler cannot modify the shared data structures while the parent is updating them.

By blocking signals, the parent ensures that any signal handler that might run during the execution of `addjob` will be deferred until the parent unblocks signals. This guarantees that the job list is updated atomically and avoids race conditions.

Explain "The parent keeps track of its current children using entries in a global job list, with one entry per job":
In a Unix shell program, the parent process (i.e., the shell) can create and manage child processes. The shell needs to keep track of the child processes it has created and their current state (e.g., running, stopped, terminated). To do this, the shell uses a job list, which is a data structure that maintains information about each child process.

The job list is a global list accessible by all functions in the program. Each entry in the list represents a single job (i.e., child process) and contains information about the job, such as its process ID, its state, and any other relevant information.

Whenever the parent process creates a new child process, it adds a new entry to the job list for that child process. This entry is used to keep track of the child's state and to manage the child's lifecycle (e.g., sending signals to the child, waiting for the child to terminate).

When a child process terminates, the parent process receives a SIGCHLD signal. The signal handler for this signal is responsible for reaping the terminated child process (i.e., removing it from the system) and updating the job list to reflect the child's new state. This involves deleting the child's entry from the job list and updating any other relevant information.

#### What's a "bad" sequence of events

1.  The parent executes the fork function and the kernel schedules the newly created child to run instead of the parent.
```c
    if ((pid = Fork()) == 0) { /* Child process */
        Execve("/bin/date", argv, NULL);
    }
```
2.  Before the parent is able to run again, the child terminates and becomes a zombie, causing the kernel to deliver a SIGCHLD signal to the parent.
In Unix, when a child process terminates, it remains in the process table with a status indicating that it has terminated, but its parent process has not yet performed the necessary cleanup, such as reading the child's exit status. This state of the child process is known as a "zombie" process.

When the child process becomes a zombie, the kernel sends a SIGCHLD signal to the parent process to notify it that one of its child processes has terminated. This signal is delivered to the parent process asynchronously, which means that the parent process may not receive the signal immediately.

In the case of the provided code, the child process is created by the parent using the `fork` system call, which creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The newly created child process then runs the `Execve` function to execute the `/bin/date` program. If the child process terminates before the parent is able to run again, it becomes a zombie process and the kernel sends a SIGCHLD signal to the parent process.

Since the parent process has registered a signal handler for the SIGCHLD signal using the `Signal` function, the handler is called when the parent process receives the signal. The handler then reaps the terminated child process by calling `waitpid` with a negative first argument, which waits for any child process to terminate and returns its PID. The `deletejob` function is then called to remove the child from the job list.

However, if the child process terminates and becomes a zombie before the parent is able to add the child process to the job list using `addjob`, then the call to `deletejob` in the signal handler will do nothing since the child process is not in the job list. This can cause a problem later on when the parent process returns from the `fork` system call and adds the (nonexistent) child process to the job list using `addjob`.

1.  Later, when the parent becomes runnable again but before it is executed, the kernel notices the pending SIGCHLD and causes it to be received by running the signal handler in the parent.

When the parent process becomes runnable again (e.g., the blocked `Sigprocmask()` call completes), the kernel notices that there is a pending `SIGCHLD` signal for the process and delivers it to the process by invoking the signal handler that was registered for that signal (`handler()` in this case).
```c
    void handler(int sig)
    {
        int olderrno = errno;
        sigset_t mask_all, prev_all;
        pid_t pid;

        Sigfillset(&mask_all);
        while ((pid = waitpid(-1, NULL, 0)) > 0) { /* Reap a zombie child */
            Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_all, &prev_all);
            deletejob(pid); /* Delete the child from the job list */
            Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_all, NULL);
        }
        if (errno != ECHILD)
            Sio_error("waitpid error");
        errno = olderrno;
    }
```

q: why might the parent not be runnable?
The parent process may not be runnable for various reasons such as if the CPU is busy executing other processes or if the parent process is blocked on some resource (e.g., waiting for a file I/O operation to complete). In this case, the parent process is blocked on the Sigprocmask() function call, which blocks the process until the SIG_BLOCK signal mask is installed. While the process is blocked, the kernel can deliver the SIGCHLD signal to the process.

When the parent process becomes runnable again (e.g., the blocked Sigprocmask() call completes), the kernel notices that there is a pending SIGCHLD signal for the process and delivers it to the process by invoking the signal handler that was registered for that signal (handler() in this case).

4.  The signal handler reaps the terminated child and calls deletejob, which does nothing because the parent has not added the child to the list yet. ^ 

5.  After the handler completes, the kernel then runs the parent, which returns from fork and incorrectly adds the (nonexistent) child to the job list by calling addjob.
```c
    while (1) {
        if ((pid = Fork()) == 0) { /* Child process */
            Execve("/bin/date", argv, NULL);
        }
        Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_all, &prev_all); /* Parent process */
        addjob(pid); /* Add the child to the job list */
        Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_all, NULL);
    }
```
The issue here is that the parent adds the child to the job list before it waits for the child to finish execution. Therefore, if the child terminates before the parent is able to run again, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the parent's signal handler will try to delete a child that has not been added to the list yet</mark>. Later, when the parent runs again, it will assume that the child has been successfully added to the list and will try to add it again, resulting in incorrect behavior.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>:
In the provided code, the signal handler `handler` is responsible for handling the SIGCHLD signal that is sent to the parent process when a child process terminates. The handler function attempts to reap the zombie child process by calling `waitpid()` function to obtain the process ID of the terminated child process. Once the PID is obtained, `deletejob()` function is called to remove the corresponding job from the job list.

However, there is a possibility that a race condition can occur, where the child process terminates and sends the SIGCHLD signal to the parent before the parent has had a chance to add the child process to the job list. In this case, the parent's signal handler will try to delete a child that has not been added to the list yet. Since `deletejob()` is not designed to handle such a scenario, it will do nothing and the job list will be left unchanged.

This can cause problems later when the parent process tries to add a new child to the job list. Since the `addjob()` function checks for duplicates in the list, it will incorrectly assume that the terminated child is still in the job list and will add a new entry for the new child. This results in the job list having duplicate entries, one of which is for a non-existent child process.

Fixed version:
The issue with the original code is that it adds the child to the job list before it is reaped, which can lead to the addition of non-existent jobs to the list. One way to fix this is to move the call to addjob() inside the signal handler, after the call to deletejob(). However, this solution may not be sufficient in some cases, such as when the parent is blocked waiting for some resource and cannot handle the SIGCHLD signal in a timely manner.

A better solution is to block SIGCHLD signals before the call to fork, and then unblock them only after we have called addjob(). By doing this, we guarantee that the child will be reaped after it is added to the job list. Additionally, we need to be careful to unblock the SIGCHLD signal in the child before calling execve(), as children inherit the blocked set of their parents.

Here's an example of how this fix might look in code:
```c
void handler(int sig)
{
    int olderrno = errno;
    sigset_t mask_all, prev_all;
    pid_t pid;
    
    Sigfillset(&mask_all);
    while ((pid = waitpid(-1, NULL, 0)) > 0) { /* Reap a zombie child */
        Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_all, &prev_all);
        deletejob(pid); /* Delete the child from the job list */
        Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_all, NULL);
    }
    if (errno != ECHILD)
        Sio_error("waitpid error");
    errno = olderrno;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int pid;
    sigset_t mask_all, mask_one, prev_one;
    
    Sigfillset(&mask_all);
    Sigemptyset(&mask_one);
    Sigaddset(&mask_one, SIGCHLD);
    Signal(SIGCHLD, handler);
    initjobs(); /* Initialize the job list */
    
    while (1) {
        Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_one, &prev_one); /* Block SIGCHLD */
        if ((pid = Fork()) == 0) { /* Child process */
            Sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &mask_one, NULL); /* Unblock SIGCHLD */
            Execve("/bin/date", argv, NULL);
        }
        Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask_all, NULL); /* Parent process */
        addjob(pid); /* Add the child to the job list */
        Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_one, NULL); /* Unblock SIGCHLD */
        Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev_all, NULL);
    }
    exit(0);
}
```
In this modified code, the parent blocks the SIGCHLD signal before calling `fork()`. This ensures that the parent will not receive the SIGCHLD signal before it is ready to handle it. After forking, the parent unblocks the SIGCHLD signal and waits for the child to terminate.

In the child process, the SIGCHLD signal is unblocked before calling `execve()` to ensure that the signal can be received if the child terminates before the parent is able to add it to the job list.

Once the child has terminated, the parent adds it to the job list and blocks the SIGCHLD signal again before looping back to wait for the next child to terminate.

By blocking the SIGCHLD signal only briefly, we ensure that the parent can handle the signal as soon as it is received, while also guaranteeing that the child is added to the job list after it has been reaped.
