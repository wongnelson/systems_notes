## 8.14
How many “hello” output lines does this program print?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_code/ecf/forkprob5.c_

```

1	#include "csapp.h"
2	
3	void doit()
4	{
5		if (Fork() == 0) {
6			Fork();
7			printf("hello\n");
8			exit(0);
9		}
10		return;
11	}
12	
13	int main()
14	{
15		doit();
16		printf("hello\n");
17		exit(0);
18	}
```

The program will print 3 "hello" output lines.

1.  The first "hello" line is printed by the child process created in line 5, which forks another child process in line 6.
    
2.  The second "hello" line is printed by the child process created in line 6.
    
3.  The third "hello" line is printed by the original process (`main`) after it returns from the `doit()` function.

## 8.15
How many “hello” lines does this program print?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_code/ecf/forkprob6.c_

```

1	#include "csapp.h"
2	
3	void doit()
4	{
5		if (Fork() == 0) {
6			Fork();
7			printf("hello\n");
8			return;
9		}
10		return;
11	}
12	
13	int main()
14	{
15		doit();
16		printf("hello\n");
17		exit(0);
18	}
```
1.  The program starts by calling `main`.
2.  `main` calls `doit`.
3.  `doit` creates a child process with the first call to `fork()`. Let's call this child process `p1`.
4.  `p1` creates another child process (`p2`) with the second call to `fork()`.
5.  Both `p1` and `p2` execute the `printf("hello\n")` statement and print "hello" to the terminal. This means that the string "hello" is printed twice.
6.  `p2` exits, and control returns to `p1`.
7.  `p1` also exits, and control returns to `main`.
8.  `main` executes the `printf("hello\n")` statement and prints "hello" to the terminal. This means that the string "hello" is printed a total of three times.

Therefore, the program will print a total of 5 "hello" lines, since "hello" is printed twice by the child processes and once by the parent process.

## 8.16
What is the output of the following program?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_code/ecf/forkprob7.c_

```

1	#include "csapp.h"
2	int counter = 1;
3	
4	int main()
5	{
6		if (fork() == 0) {
7			counter--;
8			exit(0);
9		}
10		else {
11			Wait(NULL);
12			printf("counter = %d\n", ++counter);
13		}
14		exit(0);
15	}
```
1.  The program starts by calling `main`.
2.  `main` calls `fork()`, which creates a child process. Let's call the child process `p`.
3.  In the child process (`p`), the variable `counter` is decremented from 1 to 0.
4.  The child process exits with a status of 0.
5.  In the parent process, `Wait(NULL)` waits for the child process to terminate before continuing.
6.  After the child process has terminated, the parent process (`main`) increments `counter` from 1 to 2.
7.  The parent process then executes `printf("counter = %d\n", ++counter)`, which prints "counter = 2" to the terminal.

So, the final output of the program is "counter = 2". Note that the child process decrements the value of `counter`, but since the parent process increments it afterwards, the net effect on `counter` is that it stays the same.
