```c
/*
 * mysystem.c
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include "csapp.h"

int mysystem(char* command) {
  pid_t pid;
  int status;

  if ((pid = Fork()) == 0) {
    /* child process */
    char* argv[4] = { "", "-c", command, NULL };
    execve("/bin/sh", argv, environ);
  }

  /* print child pid so we can kill it */
  printf("child pid: %d\n", pid);

The `Waitpid` function is used to wait for a child process to terminate. The function takes the child process ID as its first argument, a pointer to a `status` variable as its second argument, and options as its third argument. The function returns the child process ID if it was successful, and a negative value if an error occurred.

In this code, the `Waitpid` function is called with the child process ID `pid` and a pointer to the `status` variable, and the options set to `0`. The return value of `Waitpid` is then checked to see if it is greater than `0`. If the return value is greater than `0`, it means that `Waitpid` was successful and the child process terminated. In this case, the exit status of the child process can be retrieved and used to determine whether the child process terminated normally or by signal.

By checking the return value of `Waitpid` before examining the exit status of the child process, the code can ensure that the child process has actually terminated and the exit status is valid. If the return value of `Waitpid` is negative, it indicates an error occurred and the exit status cannot be trusted.
  if (Waitpid(pid, &status, 0) > 0) {
    /* exit normally */
    if (WIFEXITED(status))
      return WEXITSTATUS(status);

    /* exit by signal */
    if (WIFSIGNALED(status))
      return WTERMSIG(status);
  }
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  int code;

  code = mysystem("./exit-code");
  printf("normally exit, code: %d\n", code); fflush(stdout);

  code = mysystem("./wait-sig");
  printf("exit caused by signal, code: %d\n", code); fflush(stdout);
  return 0;
}

when running `./mysystem`, it runs `./exit-code`

```c
/*
 * exit-code.c
 */
#include "csapp.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  exit(10);
}


```

should output

```
normally exit, code 10
```

and runs `./wait-sig`, stuck here

```c
/*
 * wait-sig.c
 */
#include "csapp.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  while (1);
}


```

fall into dead loop. open another terminal, type

```
kill -<n> <wait-sig's pid>
```

`./mysystem` will return and output

```
exit caused by signal, code <n>
```

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

1.  The `mysystem` function starts by declaring variables for the child process ID and the exit status.
2.  The `Fork` function is called to create a new child process. If the return value of `Fork` is `0`, the code is executed in the child process.
3.  In the child process, an array of arguments is created for the `execve` function. The first argument is the path to the shell program `"/bin/sh"`, the second argument is the `"-c"` option, which tells the shell to interpret the command as a string, and the third argument is the `command` passed to `mysystem`. The fourth argument is a null pointer, which indicates the end of the argument list.
4.  The `execve` function is called to execute the shell with the specified arguments. The `execve` function replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the path and arguments. If `execve` is successful, it will not return.
5.  In the parent process, the child process ID is printed to `stdout`.
6.  The `Waitpid` function is called to wait for the child process to terminate. The first argument is the child process ID, the second argument is a pointer to the exit status variable, and the third argument is set to `0` to indicate that the function should block until the child process terminates.
7.  The `WIFEXITED` macro is used to check if the child process terminated normally by calling the `exit` function or executing a return statement. If the child process did terminate normally, the `WEXITSTATUS` macro is used to retrieve the exit status of the child process and return it from `mysystem`.
8.  If the child process did not terminate normally, the `WIFSIGNALED` macro is used to check if the child process was terminated by a signal. If the child process was terminated by a signal, the `WTERMSIG` macro is used to retrieve the signal number and return it from `mysystem`.

In the `main` function, the `mysystem` function is called twice to execute the `./exit-code` and `./wait-sig` commands. The exit status of the commands is printed to `stdout`.
