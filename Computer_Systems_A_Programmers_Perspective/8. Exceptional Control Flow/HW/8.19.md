How many lines of output does the following function print? Give your answer as a function of _n._ Assume n ≥ 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_code/ecf/forkprob8.c_

```

1	void foo(int n)
2	{
3		int i;
4	
5		for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
6			Fork();
7		printf("hello\n");
8		exit(0);
9	}
```
The number of lines of output that this function prints is 2^n.

The function creates a new process (by calling the "Fork" function on line 6) for each iteration of the for loop from 0 to n-1 (line 5). This means that each time the for loop runs, the number of processes is doubled. At the end of the loop, the number of processes will be 2^n. Each process will print "hello" on line 7, resulting in 2^n lines of output.
