What are the possible output sequences from the following program?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_code/ecf/waitprob3.c_

```

1	int main()
2	{
3		if (fork() == 0) {
4			printf("a"); fflush(stdout);
5			exit(0);
6		}
7		else {
8			printf("b"); fflush(stdout);
9			waitpidC-1, NULL, 0);
10		}
11		printf("c"); fflush(stdout);
12		exit(0);
13	}
```
In this program, after the `fork()` function is called on line 3, two processes are created: a parent process and a child process. The child process will enter the `if` block and print “a” before exiting. The parent process will enter the `else` block and print “b” before waiting for the child process to terminate using the `waitpid()` function on line 9. After the child process terminates and the parent process finishes waiting, it will print “c” before exiting.

Therefore, there are two possible output sequences for this program: “bac” and “abc”. The order of “a” and “b” depends on which process (parent or child) gets scheduled to run first after the `fork()` function call.
