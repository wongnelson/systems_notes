## Q: What are exceptions in Linux/x86-64 Systems?

A: Exceptions are interruptions of the normal program flow that occur due to specific events. In x86-64 systems, there are up to 256 different exception types, with numbers in the range from 0 to 31 defined by the Intel architects and identical for any x86-64 system, while numbers in the range from 32 to 255 correspond to interrupts and traps defined by the operating system.

## Q: What are Linux/x86-64 Faults and Aborts?

A: Linux/x86-64 Faults and Aborts are specific types of exceptions that occur in Linux systems on x86-64 architecture. Some common examples include:

-   Divide error (exception 0): occurs when an application attempts to divide by zero or when the result of a divide instruction is too big for the destination operand. Linux shells typically report divide errors as “Floating exceptions.”
-   General protection fault (exception 13): occurs due to many reasons, usually because a program references an undefined area of virtual memory or because the program attempts to write to a read-only text segment. Linux shells typically report general protection faults as “Segmentation faults.”
-   Page fault (exception 14): occurs when a program references a page of virtual memory that is not currently mapped in physical memory. The handler maps the appropriate page of virtual memory from disk into a page of physical memory and restarts the faulting instruction.
-   Machine check (exception 18): occurs as a result of a fatal hardware error that is detected during the execution of the faulting instruction. Machine check handlers never return control to the application program.

## Q: What are Linux/x86-64 System Calls?

A: Linux/x86-64 System Calls are requests for services from the Linux kernel made by application programs. Linux provides hundreds of system calls for tasks such as reading and writing files, opening and closing files, creating and terminating processes, and more. System calls are invoked using the syscall instruction, with arguments passed through general-purpose registers rather than the stack. The C standard library provides a set of convenient wrapper functions for most system calls, which package up the arguments, trap to the kernel with the appropriate system call instruction, and pass the return status of the system call back to the calling program.

## Q: How do programs invoke Linux system calls?

A: Programs can invoke Linux system calls directly by using the syscall function. However, this is rarely necessary in practice. The C standard library provides a set of convenient wrapper functions for most system calls. These wrapper functions package up the arguments, trap to the kernel with the appropriate system call instruction, and pass the return status of the system call back to the calling program. The syscall instruction is used to invoke system calls, with the syscall number stored in `%rax`and up to six arguments passed through the registers`%rdi`,` %rsi`,` %rdx`,` %r10`,` %r8`, and` %r9`. On return from the system call, the` %rax` register contains the return value. A negative return value between -4,095 and -1 indicates an error corresponding to a negative errno.


## Q: Can you provide an example of a program that invokes a Linux system call?

A: Here is an example of a program that invokes the `write` system call to write the string "hello, world\n" to stdout:

```c
int main()
{
    write(1, "hello, world\n", 13);
    _exit(0);
}

.section .data
string:
    .ascii "hello, world\n"
string_end:
    .equ len, string_end - string
.section .text
.globl main
main:
    movq $1, %rax        ; write is system call 1
    movq $1, %rdi        ; Arg1: stdout has descriptor 1
    movq $string, %rsi   ; Arg2: hello world string
    movq $len, %rdx      ; Arg3: string length
    syscall              ; Make the system call
    movq $60, %rax       ; _exit is system call 60
    movq $0, %rdi        ; Arg1: exit status is 0
    syscall              ; Make the system call

```
