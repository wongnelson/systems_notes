## Why is the division of labor between hardware and software important in handling exceptions?

The division of labor between hardware and software is important in handling exceptions because it ensures that the tasks are performed by the component that is best suited to perform them. The hardware is responsible for detecting the event and triggering the exception, while the software is responsible for handling the event and returning control to the interrupted program.
```c
 ___________     _____________
| Processor |   | Exception   |
|-----------|-->| Handler    |
| Detects   |   | in Software|
| Exception |   |____________|
| Triggers  |
|___________|
```
## Q: What is the format of an exception table?

At system boot time, the operating system allocates and initializes a jump table called an exception table. The format of the exception table is an array of entries, where each entry contains the address of the handler for a specific exception.
```c
 ___________       ____________
| Exception |     | Exception  |
|-----------|---->| Table      |
| Number k  |     | Entry k    |
|___________|     |____________|
```

## Q: How does the processor trigger an exception?

The processor triggers an exception by detecting that an event has occurred and determining the corresponding exception number `k`. The processor then triggers the exception by making an indirect procedure call, through entry `k` of the exception table, to the corresponding handler.
```c
 ___________     _____________
| Processor |   | Exception   |
|-----------|-->| Table       |
| Detects   |   | Entry k     |
| Exception |   |____________|
| Triggers  |   
|___________|
```
## Q: What is the role of the exception table base register?

The exception table base register is a special CPU register that contains the starting address of the exception table. The exception number is an index into the exception table, and the processor uses the exception table base register to form the address of the appropriate exception handler.

```c
 ___________        ____________
| Processor |      | Exception  |
|-----------|----->| Table      |
| Exception |      | Base       |
| Number k  |      | Register   |
|___________|      |____________|
```

## Q: How is an exception different from a procedure call?

### What happens when a procedure call is made?

When a procedure call is made, the processor pushes a return address on the stack. This return address indicates where the program should resume execution after the called procedure completes.

### How is an exception similar to a procedure call?

Similar to a procedure call, an exception also involves pushing a return address on the stack.

### How is the return address determined for an exception?

The "return address" in the context of an exception refers to the location in the program's code to which control should return after an exception has been handled. In other words, once the exception handling code has been run, where should the program continue executing from?

This is typically determined by the system's exception handling mechanism, and it could be either the current instruction or the next instruction.

1.  **Current Instruction**: If the return address is the current instruction, this means that after handling the exception, the program will try to execute the same instruction that caused the exception again. This could be useful in cases where the exception handler is able to fix the problem that caused the exception, so the instruction can be retried.
    
2.  **Next Instruction**: If the return address is the next instruction, this means that after handling the exception, the program will move on to the instruction that follows the one that caused the exception. This could be the case if the instruction that caused the exception is one that cannot be retried, or if the exception handler has done something to mitigate the problem so that it's safe to move on to the next instruction.
    
So, the return address for an exception determines where the program should continue executing after an exception has been handled. The exact mechanism for deciding whether the return address should be the current instruction or the next instruction can depend on a variety of factors, including the type of exception, the architecture of the system, and the programming language or runtime environment.

## Q: What is the role of the stack in handling exceptions?

The stack plays an important role in handling exceptions. When an exception is triggered, the processor pushes the return address and some additional processor state onto the stack. This state will be necessary to restart the interrupted program when the handler returns. Depending on the class of exception, the return address may be either the current instruction or the next instruction.

```c
 ___________     _____________
| Processor |   | Exception   |
|-----------|-->| Triggers    |
|           |   |_____________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Pushes Return Address &
|           |       | Additional Processor State
|           |       | onto Stack
|           |       |
|           |       V
|           | ___________
|           | | Stack     |
|           | |-----------|
|           | | Return    |
|           | | Address   |
|           | | Processor |
|           | | State     |
|           | |___________|
|___________|
