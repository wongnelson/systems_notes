## What is Explicitly Waiting for Signals and when is it needed?

Explicitly waiting for signals is a technique used in programming to ensure that a specific signal handler has executed before the main program continues with its execution. This technique is useful in cases where a program needs to coordinate the execution of multiple processes or handle external events.

A common scenario where explicitly waiting for signals is needed is when a program needs to wait for a child process to terminate before continuing with its execution. For example, a Linux shell creates a foreground job and must wait for the job to terminate and be reaped by the SIGCHLD handler before accepting the next user command.

## How is the race between parent and child handled when waiting for signals?

When waiting for signals, there is a race condition between the parent and child processes. To avoid this race, the parent process must block the signal it expects to receive from the child process. This way, the signal will be queued until the parent is ready to receive it.

In the example given in the original content, the parent process installs handlers for SIGINT and SIGCHLD and then enters an infinite loop. It blocks SIGCHLD to avoid the race between parent and child that we discussed in Section 8.5.6. After creating the child, it resets pid to zero, unblocks SIGCHLD, and then waits in a spin loop for pid to become nonzero.

## What is the issue with using a spin loop when waiting for signals?

While a spin loop is a simple solution to waiting for signals, it is wasteful of processor resources. The spin loop continuously checks if the condition to continue execution is met, which can consume a lot of CPU cycles.

## Why is using a pause in the spin loop not a good solution?

A pause in the spin loop can reduce CPU usage, but it has a serious race condition. If the signal is received after the while test but before the pause, the pause will sleep forever. This is because pause blocks until a signal is received, and if the signal was received before the pause was called, the pause will not exit.
```c
while (!pid) /* Race! */
pause ();
```
## Why is using sleep instead of pause not a good solution?

Replacing the pause with sleep can also reduce CPU usage, but it can be too slow. If the signal is received after the while and before the sleep, the program must wait a (relatively) long time before it can check the loop termination condition again. Using a higher-resolution sleep function such as nanosleep isn't acceptable, either, because there is no good rule for determining the sleep interval. Make it too small and the loop is too wasteful. Make it too high and the program is too slow.
```c
while (!pid) /* Too slow! */
sleep(1);
```
## What are some alternative solutions to using a spin loop?

There are several alternative solutions to using a spin loop when waiting for signals. One approach is to use a synchronization primitive, such as a<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> condition variable </mark>or semaphore, to signal when the signal handler has completed its execution. Another approach is to use the sigwait() function, which blocks until a specific signal is received.
```c
sigset_t set;
sigemptyset(&set);
sigaddset(&set, SIGCHLD);
int signal;
sigwait(&set, &signal);
```
In the example above, sigwait() blocks until a SIGCHLD signal is received. Once the signal is received, sigwait() returns, and the program can continue with its execution.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink:</mark>
Here's an example of how a condition variable can be used to synchronize between the signal handler and the main program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <pthread.h>

pid_t pid;
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_cond_t cond;

void sigchld_handler(int sig) {
    int status;
    pid_t child_pid;

    // Reap child processes until there are no more
    while ((child_pid = waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG)) > 0) {
        // Handle the termination of child_pid
        printf("Child process with PID %d has terminated.\n", child_pid);

        // Acquire the mutex and signal the condition variable
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        pid = child_pid;
        pthread_cond_signal(&cond);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize mutex and condition variable
    pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
    pthread_cond_init(&cond, NULL);

    // Install signal handler for SIGCHLD
    signal(SIGCHLD, sigchld_handler);

    // Create a child process
    pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process with PID %d has started.\n", getpid());
        sleep(5); // Simulate some work
        printf("Child process with PID %d has finished.\n", getpid());
        exit(0);
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process with PID %d has started.\n", getpid());

        // Wait for child process to terminate
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        while (pid == 0) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

        // Parent can continue with additional work now that the child has terminated
        printf("Parent process with PID %d is continuing with additional work.\n", getpid());
    } else {
        // Error
        perror("fork");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Clean up mutex and condition variable
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
    pthread_cond_destroy(&cond);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, a condition variable and mutex are used to synchronize between the signal handler and the main program. When the signal handler reaps a terminated child process, it acquires the mutex, sets the global `pid` variable to the PID of the terminated child process, and signals the condition variable. The main program waits on the condition variable, and the signal handler signals it when a child process has terminated. This avoids the wasteful spin loop used in the previous example, and ensures that the main program is notified immediately when a child process terminates.

Using a synchronization primitive such as a condition variable or semaphore is a better solution than using a spin loop for several reasons:

1.  **Efficiency**: A spin loop wastes CPU cycles by continuously checking a condition until it becomes true. This can cause unnecessary delays and increased power consumption. Using a synchronization primitive, on the other hand, allows the program to sleep until a signal or other event occurs, reducing CPU usage and power consumption.
    
2.  **Simplicity**: Spin loops can be difficult to implement correctly, especially when dealing with multiple threads or processes. Synchronization primitives provide a higher-level abstraction that is easier to reason about and use correctly.
    
3.  **Scalability**: Spin loops can lead to contention and poor performance in highly concurrent systems. Synchronization primitives can be used to coordinate access to shared resources, ensuring that multiple threads or processes can operate efficiently without interfering with each other.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">red</mark>
example of using `sigwait` to wait for a specific signal:
```d
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    sigset_t sigset;
    int sig;
    sigemptyset(&sigset);
    sigaddset(&sigset, SIGUSR1);
    sigaddset(&sigset, SIGUSR2);
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &sigset, NULL);
    printf("Waiting for SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2...\n");
    sigwait(&sigset, &sig);
    printf("Received signal %d\n", sig);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `sigset` variable to specify which signals we want to wait for (in this case, `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`). We then block those signals using `sigprocmask` to ensure that they are not delivered to the process until we are ready to handle them.

Next, we use `sigwait` to wait for a signal to be delivered. `sigwait` atomically unblocks the signals specified in the signal set, waits for one of them to be delivered, and then blocks them again before returning. The signal number is stored in the `sig` variable.

Using `sigwait` avoids the need for a spin loop or sleep loop, as the function blocks until a signal is received. This is more efficient, as it avoids wasting CPU cycles or unnecessarily delaying the program's execution.

### Suspend
**Q: How does sigsuspend work?**

`sigsuspend` temporarily replaces the current blocked set with the new signal mask and suspends the process until a signal is received whose action is to either run a signal handler or terminate the process. If the action is to terminate, then the process terminates without returning from `sigsuspend`. If the action is to run a handler, then `sigsuspend` returns after the handler returns, restoring the blocked set to its state when `sigsuspend` was called.


Here's an example to illustrate how `sigsuspend` can be used to temporarily modify the blocked set and control the signals that can potentially interrupt or affect the process:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

// Signal handler function
void signal_handler(int signal) {
    printf("Received signal: %d\n", signal);
}

int main() {
    sigset_t new_mask, old_mask;
    struct sigaction sa;

    // Install signal handler for SIGINT
    sa.sa_handler = signal_handler;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL);
    // This sets up a signal handler, so when a SIGINT signal (e.g., Ctrl+C) is received,
    // the signal_handler function will be called to handle it.

    // Block SIGINT before entering the critical section
    sigemptyset(&new_mask);
    sigaddset(&new_mask, SIGINT);
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &new_mask, &old_mask);
    // Here, we block the SIGINT signal to prevent it from interrupting the process
    // during the critical section. This ensures that the critical operations are not
    // disrupted by the signal.

    printf("Entering critical section\n");

    // Perform some critical operations here

    // Allow SIGINT to be delivered and suspend the process
    sigsuspend(&old_mask);
    // We call sigsuspend to suspend the process and wait for a signal to arrive.
    // By passing the old_mask, we temporarily unblock the SIGINT signal to allow
    // it to be delivered and received by the process.

    // Process resumes execution after sigsuspend returns

    printf("Exiting critical section\n");

    // Restore the original signal mask
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &old_mask, NULL);
    // Finally, we restore the original signal mask, which means we block the SIGINT
    // signal again, so it won't interrupt the process once it continues execution.

    return 0;
}
```

**Q: Why is sigsuspend a better solution than a spin loop?**

`sigsuspend` is a better solution than a spin loop because it avoids the wasteful CPU usage of a spin loop by temporarily unblocking the signal, allowing the process to sleep until the signal is received. It is more efficient than `sleep` because it atomically blocks the signal and sleeps, which eliminates the potential race where a signal is received after blocking the signal and before sleeping.
```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

volatile sig_atomic_t pid;

void sigchld_handler(int s)
{
    int olderrno = errno;
    pid = waitpid(-1, NULL, 0);
    errno = olderrno;
}

void sigint_handler(int s)
{
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    sigset_t mask, prev;
    Signal(SIGCHLD, sigchld_handler);
    Signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);
    Sigemptyset(&mask);
    Sigaddset(&mask, SIGCHLD);

    while (1) {
        Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &prev); /* Block SIGCHLD */
        if (Fork() == 0) /* Child */
            exit(0);

        /* Parent */
        pid = 0;
        Sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &prev, NULL); /* Unblock SIGCHLD */

        /* Wait for SIGCHLD to be received */
        sigsuspend(&prev); /* Temporarily unblock SIGCHLD */
        /* Return when a signal is caught */
        /* All signals are blocked when sigsuspend returns */

        /* Check if the signal caught was SIGINT */
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Caught SIGINT\n");
            exit(0);
        }

        /* Do some work after receiving SIGCHLD */
        printf(".");
    }
    exit(0);
}
```
Here, we replaced the spin loop with `sigsuspend(&prev)`. Before each call to `sigsuspend`, we block `SIGCHLD` using `Sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &prev)`. The `sigsuspend` call temporarily unblocks `SIGCHLD` and then waits until the parent catches a signal. Before returning, it restores the original blocked set, which blocks `SIGCHLD` again. If the parent caught a `SIGINT`, then the loop test succeeds and the next iteration calls `sigsuspend` again. If the parent caught a `SIGCHLD`, then the loop test fails and we exit the loop.

Using `sigsuspend` to wait for signals is better than using a spin loop because it doesn't waste CPU cycles. The spin loop in the original code continuously checks the value of `pid`, wasting CPU time even when there is no signal to handle. In contrast, `sigsuspend` blocks the process until a signal arrives, allowing the CPU to be used for other tasks in the meantime. Furthermore, `sigsuspend` is more efficient than using `sleep` because it doesn't introduce a delay. When a signal arrives, `sigsuspend` immediately unblocks the process and returns.

### Sigwait vs sigsuspend
`sigsuspend()` and `sigwait()` are similar in that both can atomically block and wait for a specific signal or signals to arrive. However, there are a few key differences:

-   `sigsuspend()` blocks the process until the specified signal arrives, whereas `sigwait()` blocks until one of a set of specified signals arrives.
-   `sigsuspend()` temporarily unblocks the signals specified in the signal mask, whereas `sigwait()` does not modify the signal mask.
-   `sigsuspend()` can be interrupted by any signal that is not blocked, whereas `sigwait()` cannot be interrupted.

## Sigwait vs sigsuspend for spin loops
Let's compare `sigsuspend` and `sigwait` as alternatives to using spin loops for signal handling:

### `sigsuspend`:
- Usage: `sigsuspend` allows a process to atomically change its signal mask and suspend its execution until a signal is received.
- Mechanism: The process replaces its current signal mask with a new mask and then waits for a signal to arrive. Once a signal is received, the process is awakened, and the original signal mask is restored.
- Benefits:
  - Efficiency: `sigsuspend` suspends the process, allowing the CPU to be used by other tasks until a signal arrives. It avoids unnecessary CPU consumption compared to spin loops that actively poll for signals.
  - Reliability: `sigsuspend` provides a synchronized and reliable way to wait for signals, ensuring they are not missed or mishandled due to timing issues or race conditions.
  - Simplicity: `sigsuspend` simplifies signal handling code by providing an explicit mechanism to wait for signals, avoiding the complexity of managing spin loops and potential race conditions.

### `sigwait`:
- Usage: `sigwait` provides a synchronized way for a process to wait for specific signals.
- Mechanism: The process explicitly waits for one of the specified signals to arrive, suspending execution until one of the desired signals is received.
- Benefits:
  - Efficiency: Similar to `sigsuspend`, `sigwait` suspends the process, freeing CPU resources for other tasks until a signal of interest arrives.
  - Selective waiting: `sigwait` allows the process to wait for specific signals, avoiding the need to handle unwanted signals. It provides fine-grained control over which signals to wait for.
  - Synchronization: `sigwait` provides synchronization between the signal handler and the main program, ensuring that signals are properly handled without the need for complex locking mechanisms.

### Comparison and Recommendations:
Both `sigsuspend` and `sigwait` offer efficient and reliable alternatives to spin loops for signal handling. Here are some considerations for choosing between them:

- If you need to wait for multiple signals or a specific set of signals, `sigwait` provides a convenient way to selectively wait for those signals.
- If you need to modify the signal mask as part of your signal handling logic, `sigsuspend` is a suitable choice as it allows atomic modification of the signal mask along with the suspension of the process.
- If you prefer a simpler approach without explicit signal masking and desire a straightforward mechanism for waiting for signals, `sigwait` can be a good option.

In summary, both `sigsuspend` and `sigwait` offer advantages over spin loops by providing efficient and synchronized ways to wait for signals. Choose `sigsuspend` if you require more flexibility in signal mask manipulation, and use `sigwait` if you need selective waiting for specific signals with simpler code.
