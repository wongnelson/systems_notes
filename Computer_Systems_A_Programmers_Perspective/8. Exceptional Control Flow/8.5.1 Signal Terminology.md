## 8.5.1Â Signal Terminology
**Q: What is a signal in operating systems?**

A signal in operating systems is a small message that notifies a process that an event of some type has occurred in the system. The signal is sent by the kernel to the destination process and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as notifying a process of an error, interrupting a running process, or sending a message from one process to another.

**Q: What are the two steps involved in the transfer of a signal to a destination process?**

The transfer of a signal to a destination process involves two distinct steps:

1.  Sending a signal: The kernel sends (delivers) a signal to a destination process by updating some state in the context of the destination process. The signal is delivered for one of two reasons: (1) The kernel has detected a system event such as a divide-by-zero error or the termination of a child process. (2) A process has invoked the kill function to explicitly request the kernel to send a signal to the destination process. A process can send a signal to itself.
    
2.  Receiving a signal: A destination process receives a signal when it is forced by the kernel to react in some way to the delivery of the signal. The process can either ignore the signal, terminate, or catch the signal by executing a user-level function called a signal handler.
    

**Q: What is a signal handler?**

A signal handler is a user-level function that a process can execute in response to receiving a signal. When a signal is delivered to a process, the kernel transfers control to the signal handler specified by the process for that particular signal. The signal handler can perform any necessary processing in response to the signal, such as cleaning up resources, logging information, or restarting a process. After the signal handler finishes executing, control is returned to the interrupted program.

**Q: What is a pending signal and its details?**

A pending signal is a signal that has been sent but not yet received by a process. At any point in time, there can be at most one pending signal of a particular type. If a process has a pending signal of type k, then any subsequent signals of type k sent to that process are not queued; they are simply discarded.

### What is a blocked signal?

A blocked signal refers to a signal that a process has selectively prevented from being received. When a signal is blocked, it can still be delivered to the process, but the resulting pending signal will not be received until the process unblocks the signal.

### Why would you want to block a signal?

Blocking a signal serves various purposes, such as:

- Preventing interruptions: You may want to block a signal to prevent it from interrupting certain critical sections of code. For example, during sensitive operations like updating critical data structures or performing system calls, blocking specific signals ensures they are not delivered and handled until the operation completes.

- Handling signals at a specific time: If a process has a signal handler registered for a particular signal but is not ready to handle it at the moment, it can block that signal until it is prepared to handle it. This allows the process to defer the handling of the signal until a more suitable time.

- Synchronization and resource access control: Blocking signals can be useful in implementing synchronization primitives like semaphores and mutexes. By blocking certain signals during critical sections of code that access shared resources, a process can ensure exclusive access to those resources and prevent interference from other processes.

### **Q: What is the difference between a program and a process in operating systems?**

A program is a collection of code and data that can exist as object files on disk or as segments in an address space. A process, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a program in execution; a program always runs in the context of some process. The distinction between a program and a process is important for understanding concepts such as fork and execve functions. The fork function creates a new child process that is a duplicate of the parent process, while the execve function loads and runs a new program in the context of the current process.
