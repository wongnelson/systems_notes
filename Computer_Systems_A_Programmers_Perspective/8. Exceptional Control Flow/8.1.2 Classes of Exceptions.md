## Q: What are the four classes of exceptions?

The four classes of exceptions are:

1.  Interrupts
2.  Traps
3.  Faults
4.  Aborts

## Q: What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous exceptions?
Exceptions in computing are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's instructions. They can be categorized into two types: synchronous and asynchronous.

1.  **Synchronous Exceptions**: These exceptions are predictable and usually happen as a direct result of a particular instruction. For example, if a program tries to divide a number by zero, a synchronous exception occurs. The "synchronous" part means that the exception is in sync with the program's instructions - it happens at a well-defined point in the program when it tries to execute a specific instruction. Other examples of synchronous exceptions include attempting to access a null reference, or trying to read/write protected memory.
    
2.  **Asynchronous Exceptions**: These exceptions are unpredictable and are usually caused by events outside the program's control. For instance, a hardware failure, an incoming network request, or a user pressing Ctrl+C to interrupt the program could cause an asynchronous exception. The "asynchronous" part means that the exception is not directly tied to the program's instructions - it can happen at any time, no matter what the program is currently doing.
    

The primary difference between the two is their origin. Synchronous exceptions are typically caused by the program itself, while asynchronous exceptions are typically caused by external events. Additionally, handling asynchronous exceptions can be more complex because they can occur at any point in a program's execution, whereas synchronous exceptions occur at a specific instruction.

## Q: What is the purpose of interrupts?

Interrupts occur as a result of signals from I/O devices that are external to the processor. They are triggered by the I/O devices signaling a pin on the processor chip and placing the exception number that identifies the device that caused the interrupt onto the system bus. The exception handler for hardware interrupts is often called an interrupt handler and returns control to the next instruction in the application program's control flow.

```c
 ___________     ____________
| I/O Device |   | Processor  |
|-----------|-->| Interrupt  |
|           |   |____________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Calls Interrupt Handler
|           |       |
|           |       V
|           | ___________
|           | | Interrupt|
|           | | Handler  |
|           | |__________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Returns Control to Next Instruction
|           |       |
|___________|       V
                      __________
                     | Application|
                     | Program    |
                     |____________|
```

## Q: What is the purpose of traps?

Traps are intentional exceptions that occur as a result of executing an instruction. The most important use of traps is to provide a procedure-like interface between user programs and the kernel, known as a system call. A system call is a request for service from the kernel and is executed by executing a special syscall instruction. When a syscall instruction is executed, it causes a trap to an exception handler that decodes the argument and calls the appropriate kernel routine. The trap handler returns control to the next instruction in the application program's control flow.

```c
 ___________     ____________
| Application|   | Processor  |
| Program    |-->| Trap       |
|-----------|   |____________|
| Executes  |       |
| Syscall   |       | Calls Trap Handler
| Instruction|       |
|___________|       V
                      ___________
                     | Trap      |
                     | Handler   |
                     |___________|
                           |
                           | Returns Control to Next Instruction
                           |
                           V
                      __________
                     | Application|
                     | Program    |
                     |____________|
```

## Q: What is the purpose of faults?

Faults result from error conditions that a handler might be able to correct. When a fault occurs, the processor transfers control to the fault handler. If the handler is able to correct the error condition, it returns control to the faulting instruction, thereby re-executing it. Otherwise, the handler returns to an abort routine in the kernel that terminates the application program that caused the fault.
```c
 ___________     ____________
| Processor |   | Fault      |
|-----------|-->| Occurrence  |
|           |   |____________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Calls Fault Handler
|           |       |
|           |       V
|           | ___________
|           | | Fault    |
|           | | Handler  |
|           | |__________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Depending on Error Correction:
|           |       |  - Returns Control to Faulting Instruction
|           |       |  - Returns to Abort Routine
|___________|       V
                      ___________
                     | Abort     |
                     | Routine   |
                     |___________|
                           |
                           | Terminates Application Program
                           |
                           V
                      __________
                     | Application|
                     | Program    |
                     | Terminated |
                     |____________|

```

## Q: What is the purpose of aborts?

Aborts result from unrecoverable fatal errors, typically hardware errors such as parity errors that occur when DRAM or SRAM bits are corrupted. Abort handlers never return control to the application program. The handler returns control to an abort routine that terminates the application program.
```c
 ___________     ____________
| Processor |   | Abort      |
|-----------|-->| Occurrence  |
|           |   |____________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Calls Abort Handler
|           |       |
|           |       V
|           | ___________
|           | | Abort   |
|           | | Handler |
|           | |_________|
|           |       |
|           |       | Returns to Abort Routine
|___________|       V
                      ___________
                     | Abort     |
                     | Routine   |
                     |___________|
                           |
                           | Terminates Application Program
                           |
                           V
                      __________
                     | Application|
                     | Program    |
                     | Terminated |
                     |____________|
