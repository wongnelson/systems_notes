## What are exceptions in computer systems?

### What are exceptions?

Exceptions are a form of exceptional control flow that enable a computer system to respond to unexpected events or errors that occur during program execution.

### What can cause exceptions?

Exceptions can be caused by both hardware and software. Examples of hardware exceptions include power failure or illegal instructions, while software exceptions include out of memory errors or division by zero.

### What is the purpose of exceptions?

The purpose of exceptions is to handle and recover from exceptional or erroneous situations that may occur during program execution. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of program execution is interrupted, and the control is transferred to an exception handler that can handle the exception appropriately.

### What happens when an exception is raised?

When an exception is raised, the system starts searching for an appropriate exception handler to handle the exception.

### How does the system search for an appropriate exception handler?

The system searches for an exception handler by unwinding the call stack. It checks each enclosing scope in reverse order to see if any registered exception handlers can handle the specific type of exception that was raised.

Example: When an exception is raised in a `try` block, Python looks for a matching `except` block that can handle the exception. If it finds one, it executes the code inside the `except` block. If it doesn't find a matching `except` block in the current function, it begins to unwind the stack.

It looks at the function that called the current function, checking if that function has a `try`/`except` block that can handle the exception. If not, it keeps going up the stack, from one function to the function that called it, until it finds an `except` block that matches the exception, or until it has gone through all the functions on the stack.

If it goes through all the functions without finding a matching `except` block, Python terminates the program and prints an unhandled exception message. This is why it's important to have appropriate error handling in your code to manage any potential exceptions that might occur.

## How are exceptions implemented in computer systems?
### How are exceptions implemented?

Exceptions are implemented partly by the hardware and partly by the operating system. Because they are partly implemented in hardware, the details can vary from system to system. However, the basic ideas are the same for every system.

### What is the exception vector?

The exception handler is also a memory location known as the "exception vector". This memory location is typically predefined by the operating system. When an exception occurs, the hardware saves the current state of the processor and then jumps to the memory location specified by the exception vector. This memory location contains the starting address of the exception handler code, which the hardware then executes.
