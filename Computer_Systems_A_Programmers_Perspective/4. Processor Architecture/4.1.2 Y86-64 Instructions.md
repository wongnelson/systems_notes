### What is the Y86-64 instruction set?

The Y86-64 instruction set is a simplified version of the x86-64 instruction set, primarily used for educational purposes. It includes only 8-byte integer operations, has fewer addressing modes, and offers a smaller set of operations.

### How does the Y86-64 instruction set differ from the x86-64 instruction set?

Some key differences between the Y86-64 and x86-64 instruction sets include:

1.  Y86-64 has only 8-byte integer operations, while x86-64 supports a variety of data sizes.
2.  Y86-64 has fewer addressing modes, offering a simpler base and displacement format for memory references.
3.  Y86-64 has a smaller set of operations and splits the x86-64 `movq` instruction into four different instructions: `irmovq`, `rrmovq`, `mrmovq`, and `rmmovq`.
4.  Y86-64 integer operation instructions operate only on register data, whereas x86-64 allows operations on memory data.

### What are the four Y86-64 instructions derived from the x86-64 movq instruction?

The x86-64 `movq` instruction is split into four different Y86-64 instructions:

1.  `irmovq`: Immediate to register transfer.
2.  `rrmovq`: Register to register transfer.
3.  `mrmovq`: Memory to register transfer.
4.  `rmmovq`: Register to memory transfer.

These instructions explicitly indicate the form of the source and destination, which helps when implementing the instructions.

### What are the Y86-64 integer operation instructions?

There are four Y86-64 integer operation instructions, operating only on register data:

1.  `addq`: Addition.
2.  `subq`: Subtraction.
3.  `andq`: Bitwise AND.
4.  `xorq`: Bitwise XOR.

These instructions set the three condition codes: ZF (zero), SF (sign), and OF (overflow).

### How does the Y86-64 call instruction work?

The `call` instruction in Y86-64 pushes the return address on the stack and jumps to the destination address. The `ret` instruction returns from such a call. This is similar to the behavior of the `call` and `ret` instructions in x86-64.
