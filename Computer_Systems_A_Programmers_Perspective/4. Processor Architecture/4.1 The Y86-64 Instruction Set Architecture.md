### What is programmer-visible state?

Programmer-visible state refers to the part of the processor state that can be accessed and modified by each instruction in a program. This state is visible to a programmer writing assembly code or a compiler generating machine-level code.

### What are the components of the Y86-64 programmer-visible state?

The Y86-64 programmer-visible state is similar to the x86-64 state and includes the following components:

1.  **15 Program Registers**: %rax, %rcx, %rdx, %rbx, %rsp, %rbp, %rsi, %rdi, and %r8 through %r14. Each register stores a 64-bit word. Register %rsp is used as a stack pointer by the push, pop, call, and return instructions.
2.  **3 Single-bit Condition Codes**: ZF, SF, and OF, which store information about the effect of the most recent arithmetic or logical instruction.
3.  **Program Counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the instruction currently being executed.
4.  **Memory**: A large array of bytes, holding both program and data. Y86-64 programs reference memory locations using virtual addresses, which are translated into physical addresses by the hardware and operating system.
5.  **Status Code (Stat)**: Indicates the overall state of program execution, such as normal operation or an exception (e.g., reading from an invalid memory address).

### How do Y86-64 programs reference memory locations?

Y86-64 programs reference memory locations using virtual addresses. A combination of hardware and operating system software translates these virtual addresses into physical addresses, which indicate where the values are actually stored in memory.

### What is the purpose of the status code (Stat) in the Y86-64 programmer-visible state?

The status code (Stat) indicates the overall state of program execution. It can signal normal operation or that some sort of exception has occurred, such as when an instruction attempts to read from an invalid memory address.
