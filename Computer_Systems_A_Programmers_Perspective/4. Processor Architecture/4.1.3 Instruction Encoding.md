### How is instruction encoding done in Y86-64?

Y86-64 instruction encoding is done using byte-level encodings of the instructions. Each instruction requires between 1 and 10 bytes, depending on which fields are required. Every instruction has an initial byte identifying the instruction type, which is split into two 4-bit parts: the high-order (code) part and the low-order (function) part.

Example:
Suppose we want to encode the instruction `irmovq $0x1234, %rax`, which moves the constant value `0x1234` into the `%rax` register using the `irmovq` instruction. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">This instruction has a one-byte instruction prefix (`0x20`)</mark>, followed by a 1-byte immediate value representing the constant (`0x34`), and a 1-byte register identifier for the destination register (`0x00` for `%rax`). The total encoding for this instruction is 3 bytes.

To encode this instruction, we would start by identifying the instruction type and function code from the Y86-64 instruction set architecture. In this case, the instruction type is `irmovq`, which has a code of `0x20`, and the function code is not used, so it is set to `0x0`.

Next, we would encode the instruction fields in the order specified by the Y86-64 encoding rules. In this case, we would start with the 1-byte instruction prefix (`0x20`), which represents the `irmovq` instruction. We would then encode the immediate value `0x1234` in the next byte as two hexadecimal digits, `0x34` and `0x12`. Finally, we would encode the destination register `%rax` in the last byte as the register identifier `0x0`.

The resulting encoding for this instruction would be:

`0x20 0x34 0x12 0x00`

Here, the first byte `0x20` represents the `irmovq` instruction, the second and third bytes `0x34 0x12` represent the constant value `0x1234`, and the last byte `0x00` represents the destination register `%rax`.

In the Y86-64 instruction set architecture, each instruction is identified by an initial byte, known as the instruction prefix, which specifies the type of the instruction. The instruction prefix is always the first byte of the instruction encoding, and it is used by the processor to identify which instruction is being executed.

In the example provided, the instruction `irmovq $0x1234, %rax` has an instruction prefix of `0x20`, which is the code for the `irmovq` instruction. This means that when the processor encounters this instruction during program execution, it will recognize the instruction prefix `0x20` as the `irmovq` instruction, and it will execute the corresponding behavior associated with that instruction.

The instruction prefix is typically one byte in length, and it may be split into two 4-bit parts, with the high-order part representing the instruction code and the low-order part representing the function code (if applicable). In the case of the `irmovq` instruction, the function code is not used, so the entire byte is dedicated to specifying the instruction code.
### What is the significance of the function part in Y86-64 instruction encoding?

The function part of the Y86-64 instruction encoding is significant only for cases where a group of related instructions share a common code. It specifies a particular integer operation, branch condition, or data transfer condition for those instructions. Let's take the example of the addq and subq instructions in Y86-64 to see how function codes are used.

The addq instruction performs the operation of adding two quadword values together, while the subq instruction performs the operation of subtracting one quadword value from another.

Both instructions have the same opcode of 60, which is 01100000 in binary. However, they differ in their function code, which is encoded in the least significant 4 bits of the instruction. The function code for addq is 0000, while the function code for subq is 0001. This means that the binary representation of the addq instruction is 01100000 0000, while the binary representation of the subq instruction is 01100000 0001.

When the processor receives an instruction, it first decodes the opcode to determine which instruction is being executed. It then uses the function code to determine the specific operation that needs to be performed.

For example, if the processor receives the binary representation 01100000 0000, it knows that the instruction is addq, and it uses the function code 0000 to perform the addition operation. On the other hand, if the processor receives the binary representation 01100000 0001, it knows that the instruction is subq, and it uses the function code 0001 to perform the subtraction operation.

In this way, function codes allow for multiple related instructions to be encoded within a single opcode, reducing the size of the instruction set and simplifying the decoding process for the processor.

### What are the register identifiers in Y86-64?

In Y86-64, each of the 15 program registers has an associated register identifier (ID) ranging from 0 to 0xE. The numbering of registers in Y86-64 matches what is used in x86-64. The register IDs serve as addresses within the CPU's register file. ID value 0xF is used when no register should be accessed.

For example, here are some of the register identifiers:

-   %rax: 0
-   %rcx: 1
-   %rdx: 2
-   %rsp: 4
-   %rbp: 5
-   %rsi: 6
-   %rdi: 7
-   %r8: 8
-   %r9: 9
-   %r10: A
-   %r11: B
-   %r12: C
-   %r13: D
-   %r14: E

### How are operands encoded in Y86-64 instructions?

Operands in Y86-64 instructions are encoded using additional bytes. Instructions that require operands have longer encodings, which may include:

1.  A register specifier byte, specifying either one or two registers (rA and rB).
2.  An 8-byte constant word, which can serve as immediate data for `irmovq`, the displacement for `rmmovq` and `mrmovq` address specifiers, and the destination of branches and calls.

### How can the byte encoding of a Y86-64 instruction be generated?

To generate the byte encoding of a Y86-64 instruction, follow these steps:

1.  Identify the initial byte for the instruction from the Y86-64 instruction set.
2.  Determine the register specifier byte (if required) using the register identifiers.
3.  Encode the constant word (if required) in little-endian format.

For example, consider the instruction `rmmovq %rsp, 0x123456789abcd(%rdx)`:

1.  From the Y86-64 instruction set, `rmmovq` has an initial byte `40`.
2.  The register specifier byte for source register %rsp (rA) and base register %rdx (rB) is `42`.
3.  The displacement is encoded in the 8-byte constant word as `cd ab 89 67 45 23 01 00`.

The final instruction encoding is `4042cdab896745230100`.

### Why is it important for the byte encodings of an instruction set to have a unique interpretation?

It's important for the byte encodings of an instruction set to have a unique interpretation so that a processor can execute an object-code program without any ambiguity about the meaning of the code. This property ensures that the instruction sequence can be determined as long as the processor starts from the first byte in the sequence. However, if the starting position of a code sequence is unknown, it can be challenging to split the sequence

### 4.1
```
1	0x100:				| .pos 0x100 # Start code at address 0x100
2	0x100: 30f30f00000000000000	|	irmovq $15,%rbx
3	0x10a: 2031			|	rrmovq %rbx,%rcx
4	0x10c:				| loop:
5	0x10c: 4013fdffffffffffffff	|	rmmovq %rcx,-3(%rbx)
6	0x116: 6031			|	addq %rbx,%rcx
7	0x118: 700c01000000000000	|	jmp loop
```

Several features of this encoding are worth noting:

-   Decimal 15 (line 2) has hex representation `0x000000000000000f`. Writing the bytes in reverse order gives `Of 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`.
    
-   Decimal -3 (line 5) has hex representation `0xfffffffffffffffd`. Writing the bytes in reverse order gives `fd ff ff ff ff ff ff ff`.
    
-   The code starts at address `0x100`. The first instruction requires 10 bytes, while the second requires 2. Thus, the loop target will be `0x0000010c`. Writing these bytes in reverse order gives `0c 01 00 00 00 00 00 00`.

GPT:
Here's a breakdown of each line and what it represents:

1.  `.pos 0x100` specifies that the object code should start at address `0x100`.
    
2.  `irmovq $15, %rbx` moves the constant value `15` into register `%rbx` using the `irmovq` instruction. The byte encoding for this instruction is:
    
    `30 f3 0f 00 00 00 00 00 00`
    
    The `30` byte is the instruction prefix for `irmovq`, and the `f3` byte is the 4-bit code for `%rbx` followed by the 4-bit function code, which is not used. The next 8 bytes represent the constant value `15`, written in little-endian byte order.
    
3.  `rrmovq %rbx, %rcx` copies the value of `%rbx` into `%rcx` using the `rrmovq` instruction. The byte encoding for this instruction is:
    
    `20 31`
    
    The `20` byte is the instruction prefix for `rrmovq`, and the `31` byte is the 4-bit code for `%rcx` followed by the 4-bit code for `%rbx`.
    
4.  `loop:` is a label indicating the start of the loop.
    
5.  `rmmovq %rcx, -3(%rbx)` stores the value of `%rcx` at the memory address `%rbx - 3` using the `rmmovq` instruction. The byte encoding for this instruction is:
    
    `40 13 fd ff ff ff ff ff`
    
    The `40` byte is the instruction prefix for `rmmovq`, and the `13` byte is the 4-bit code for `%rcx` followed by the 4-bit code for `%rbx`. The next 8 bytes represent the negative offset `-3` in little-endian byte order.
    
6.  `addq %rbx, 7, %rcx` adds `7` to the value of `%rbx` and stores the result in `%rcx` using the `addq` instruction. The byte encoding for this instruction is:
    
    `60 31`
    
    The `60` byte is the instruction prefix for `addq`, and the `31` byte is the 4-bit code for `%rcx` followed by the 4-bit code for `%rbx`. The constant value `7` is represented implicitly as an immediate value.
    
7.  `jmp loop` jumps to the `loop` label using the `jmp` instruction

#### Why do we go from 0x100 to 0x10a?
The Y86-64 instruction encoding uses byte-level encodings of the instructions, with each instruction requiring between 1 and 10 bytes, depending on which fields are required. The `irmovq` instruction in line 2 is encoded using 10 bytes:

`30 f3 0f 00 00 00 00 00 00`

This means that the next available memory address after the `irmovq` instruction is `0x100` + 10 bytes = `0x10a`.

The `rrmovq` instruction in line 3 is then encoded using 2 bytes:

`20 31`

Since `0x10a` is the next available memory address after the `irmovq` instruction, the assembler assigns this address to the `rrmovq` instruction.

So, `0x10a` is the next address space after `0x100` in the Y86-64 instruction sequence because it is the memory address assigned to the next instruction in the sequence after the encoding of the `irmovq` instruction.
