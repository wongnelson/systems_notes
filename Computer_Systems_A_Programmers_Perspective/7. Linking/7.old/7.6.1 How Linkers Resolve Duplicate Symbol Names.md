q; what's the input to the linker?
a; a collection of relocatable object modules

q; what do each of those modules define?
a; a set of symbols - local and global

## Multiple modules defining global symbols with the same name

q; what happens at compile time?
a; the compiler categorizes each global symbol as either strong or weak and exports this information to the assembler

q; which symbols are strong and which are weak?
a; Functions and initialized global variables are assigned strong symbols, while uninitialized global variables are assigned weak symbols.

q; what three rules does the linker use to handle duplicate symbol names?
a; 
1.  Multiple strong symbols with the same name are not allowed.
2.  If a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols have the same name, the strong symbol is chosen.
3.  If multiple weak symbols have the same name, any of the weak symbols can be chosen.

For example, if two modules both define the "main" function as strong symbols, the linker will raise an error (Rule 1):
```c
/* foo1.c */
int main()
{
	return 0;
}

/* bar1.c */
int main()
{
	return 0;
}

linux> gcc foo1.c bar1.c
/tmp/ccq2Uxnd.o: In function `main':
bar1.c:(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `main'
```

Similarly, if two modules both define the symbol "x" as strong symbols, the linker will raise an error (Rule 1):
```c
/* foo2.c */
int x = 15213;

int main()
{
	return 0;
}

/* bar2.c */
int x = 15213;

void f()
{
}
```
However, if one of the symbols is uninitialized, the linker will choose the strong symbol (Rule 2):
```c
/* foo3.c */
#include <stdio.h>
void f(void);

int x = 15213;

int main()
{
	f();
	printf("x = %d\n", x);
	return 0;
}

/* bar3.c */
int x;

void f()
{
	x = 15212;
}

linux> gcc -o foobar3 foo3.c bar3.c
linux>  ./foobar3
x = 15212
```

The same can happen if there are multiple weak definitions of a symbol (Rule 3):
```c
/* foo4.c */
#include <stdio.h>
void f(void);

int x;

int main()
{
	x = 15213;
	f();
	printf("x = %d\n", x);
	return 0;
}

/* bar4.c */
int x;

void f()
{
	x = 15212;
}
```
In a scenario where two modules define the same symbol with different data types, this can lead to subtle and dangerous bugs. For example, if one module defines a symbol as an int and another as a double, the assignment in the latter module may overwrite the memory locations of other variables:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
void f(void);

int y = 15212;
int x = 15213;

int main()
{
	f();
	printf("x = 0x%x y = 0x%x\n", x, y);
	return 0;
}

/* bar5.c */
double x;

void f()
{
	x = -0.0;
}

linux> gcc -Wall -0g -o foobar5 foo5.c bar5.c
/usr/bin/ld: Warning: alignment 4 of symbol `x' in /tmp/cclUFK5g.o
is smaller than 8 in /tmp/ccbTLcb9.o
linux> ./foobar5
x = 0x0 y = 0x80000000
```
This is a subtle and nasty bug, especially because it triggers only a warning from the linker, and because it typically manifests itself much later in the execution of the program, far away from where the error occurred. In a large system with hundreds of modules, a bug of this kind is extremely hard to fix, especially because many programmers are not aware of how linkers work, and because they often ignore compiler warnings.

To avoid these issues, it's recommended to use the gcc flag -fno-common, which triggers an error if it encounters multiply-defined global symbols, or the -Werror option, which turns all warnings into errors. In large systems with many modules, it's crucial to be aware of how the linker works and to take the necessary precautions to ensure the stability and reliability of the program.

### 7.2
1.  In this problem, let `REF(x.i) → DEF(x.k)` denote that the linker will associate an arbitrary reference to symbol `x` in module `i` to the definition of `x` in module `k`. For each example that follows, use this notation to indicate how the linker would resolve references to the multiply-defined symbol in each module. If there is a link-time error (rule 1), write "error". If the linker arbitrarily chooses one of the definitions (rule 3), write "unknown".
    
    1.  ```
        /* Module 1 */		/* Module 2 */
        int main()		int main;
        {			int p2()
        }			{
        			}
        (a) REF(main.1) → DEF(main.1)
		`main` in module 1 is a function definition. According to the rules for dealing with duplicate symbol names in Linux, multiple strong symbols with the same name are not allowed (Rule 1), and given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols with the same name, the linker chooses the strong symbol (Rule 2). Since `main` in module 1 is a strong symbol, the linker resolves the reference to `main` in module 1 to its own definition.

	Therefore, the correct answer is REF(main.1) → DEF(main.1), indicating that the linker associates the reference to `main` in module 1 to the definition of `main` in module 1.
        (b) REF(main.2) → DEF(main.1)
		the linker associates the reference to `main` in module 2 to the definition of `main` in module 1. This is because `main` in module 1 is a function definition, which gets a strong symbol, and `main` in module 2 is an uninitialized variable, which gets a weak symbol. The linker chooses the strong symbol over the weak symbols (Rule 2), so it resolves the reference to `main` in module 2 to the definition of `main` in module 1.
        ```
    2.  ```
        /* Module 1 */		/* Module 2 */
        void main()		int main = 1;
        {			int p2()
        }			{
        			}
        (a) REF(main.1) → DEF(_____._____)
        (b) REF(main.2) → DEF(_____._____)
        ```
		This is an `error`, because each module defines a strong symbol `main` (rule 1).
        
    3.  ```
        /* Module 1 */		/* Module 2 */
        intx;			doublex=1.0;
        void main()		int p2()
        {			{
        }			}
        The linker chooses the strong symbol defined in module 2 over the weak symbol defined in module 1 (rule 2):

		REF(x.1) → DEF(x.2)
		
		REF(x.2) → DEF(x.2)
        ```
