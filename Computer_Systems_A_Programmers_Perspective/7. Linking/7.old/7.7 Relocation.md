q; after symbol resolution - what does the linker know?
a; the linker now knows the exact sizes of the code and data sections in its input object modules

q; with ^, what step is ready and what does it do?
a;  It is now ready to begin the relocation step, where it merges the input modules and assigns run-time addresses to each symbol

q; what are the two steps to relocation?
a; Relocating sections and symbol definitions and Relocating symbol references within sections

q; explain Relocating symbol references within sections
a; 
1. In the first stage of relocation, the linker combines sections of the same type into a single, larger section. For instance, all the .data sections from the input modules become one .data section in the output executable file.
2. The linker then assigns run-time memory addresses to these new sections, as well as to each symbol definition in the input modules.

	By the end of this step, every instruction and global variable will have a unique memory address at run-time.

<summary>example</summary>
Input Modules:

Module 1: .text main: mov eax, 5 add eax, 3 ret

.data symbol_A: 0x0000 symbol_B: 0x0004

Module 2: .text function1: mov ebx, 2 mul ebx, 4 ret

.data symbol_C: 0x0008 symbol_D: 0x000C

Linker:

Merges the .text sections of the input modules into a single, larger .text section:

.text main: mov eax, 5 add eax, 3 ret function1: mov ebx, 2 mul ebx, 4 ret

Merges the .data sections of the input modules into a single, larger .data section:

.data symbol_A: 0x0000 symbol_B: 0x0004 symbol_C: 0x0008 symbol_D: 0x000C

Assigns run-time memory addresses to each symbol and section:

.text main: 0x1000 mov eax, 5 add eax, 3 ret function1: 0x1004 mov ebx, 2 mul ebx, 4 ret

.data symbol_A: 0x2000 symbol_B: 0x2004 symbol_C: 0x2008 symbol_D: 0x200C

In this example, the linker merges the .text and .data sections of the two input modules into single, larger sections in the output file. It then assigns run-time memory addresses to each symbol and section. For example, the main function in the first module is assigned the memory address 0x1000, and symbol_A in the .data section is assigned the memory address 0x2000.

Note: The memory addresses shown above are just examples and may differ in actual scenarios.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; explain Relocating symbol references within sections</mark>
a; the linker updates every symbol reference within the code and data sections to point to the correct run-time addresses. The linker uses relocation entries in the input object modules as a guide, modifying the symbol references as necessary.
<details><summary>example</summary>
Here's a more detailed example of the second stage of relocation:

Input Modules:

Module 1: .text main: mov eax, 5 add eax, symbol_A ret

.data symbol_A: 0x0000 symbol_B: 0x0004

Module 2: .text function1: mov ebx, symbol_C mul ebx, 4 ret

.data symbol_C: 0x0008 symbol_D: 0x000C

Linker (after completing the first stage of relocation):

.text main: 0x1000 mov eax, 5 add eax, symbol_A ret function1: 0x1004 mov ebx, symbol_C mul ebx, 4 ret

.data symbol_A: 0x2000 symbol_B: 0x2004 symbol_C: 0x2008 symbol_D: 0x200C

Relocates symbol references within sections:

.text main: 0x1000 mov eax, 5 add eax, 0x2000 ret function1: 0x1004 mov ebx, 0x2008 mul ebx, 4 ret

.data symbol_A: 0x2000 symbol_B: 0x2004 symbol_C: 0x2008 symbol_D: 0x200C

In this example, the linker modifies the symbol references in the .text sections so that they point to the correct run-time addresses. For example, in the main function, the reference to symbol_A is updated to point to its run-time address of 0x2000. Similarly, in the function1, the reference to symbol_C is updated to point to its run-time address of 0x2008. By the end of this step, each symbol reference in the code will have a unique run-time memory address.

Note: The memory addresses shown above are just examples and may differ in actual scenarios.

## 7.7.1 Relocation Entries

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; When an assembler generates an object module, it does not know where the code and data will ultimately be stored in memory. Nor does it know the locations of any externally defined functions or global variables that are referenced by the module. Why?</mark>
a; because this information is determined by the linker, which is a separate component of the toolchain.

The reason the assembler does not know the memory locations of the code and data is that the object module is generated in a relative and symbolic manner. This means that the addresses used by the code and data in the object module are relative to each other, rather than absolute memory addresses. The linker is responsible for converting these relative addresses into absolute memory addresses, taking into account the memory layout of the target system and the memory requirements of all of the object modules that make up the final executable program.

Similarly, the assembler does not know the locations of externally defined functions or global variables that are referenced by the module. This information is also determined by the linker, which resolves the references to these external symbols by linking the object modules together into a single executable program. The linker uses a symbol table to keep track of the locations of all external symbols, and it updates the object modules to reflect the final memory locations of these symbols.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; what happens when the assembler encounters a reference to an object whose ultimate location is unknown?</mark>
a;  it generates a _relocation entry_ that tells the linker how to modify the reference when it merges the object file into an executable.  Relocation entries for code are placed in `.rel.text`. Relocation entries for data are placed in `.rel.data.`

q; what info does the relocation entry specify?
a; info that the linker or loader uses to modify a section's data so that it can refer to the correct memory locations of symbols in other sections or in other filesa

This is an ELF relocation entry
```c
1	typedef struct {
2		long offset;		/* Offset of the reference to relocate */
3		long type:32,		/* Relocation type */
4			symbol:32;	/* Symbol table index */
5		long addend;		/* Constant part of relocation expression */
6	} Elf64_Rela;
```

q; what does the offset field represent?
a; represents the section offset of the reference that needs to be modified. This offset is relative to the beginning of the section that the relocation entry belongs to, and it points to the location in the section's data that needs to be modified/tells the linker or loader where in the section's data to apply the relocation.

q; what's the relocation type?
a; 
In the context of ELF files, relocation type is a field in a relocation entry that specifies the type of relocation to be performed on a section's data. Relocation type determines how the section's data will be modified so that it can correctly reference a symbol defined in another section or file.

The relocation type is stored as a value in the `type` field of the `Elf64_Rela` structure. The possible values of this field depend on the specific architecture and operating system, and they are defined in the system's ABI (Application Binary Interface) specification.

For example, on the x86_64 architecture, some of the possible relocation types include:

-   `R_X86_64_64`: 64-bit absolute relocation
-   `R_X86_64_32`: 32-bit absolute relocation
-   `R_X86_64_PC32`: 32-bit PC-relative relocation
-   `R_X86_64_PLT32`: 32-bit PLT-relative relocation
-   `R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX`: 32-bit PC-relative relocation to the GOT entry for a symbol

Each relocation type specifies a different way to calculate the correct memory address of a symbol and modify the section data accordingly. For example, a `R_X86_64_64` relocation specifies that a 64-bit absolute memory address needs to be calculated for the symbol and stored in the section data. A `R_X86_64_PC32` relocation specifies that a 32-bit offset relative to the program counter needs to be calculated for the symbol and stored in the section data.

The specific relocation type used for a symbol depends on the context in which the symbol is used. For example, a symbol used in a global variable declaration might require a different relocation type than a symbol used in a function call.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; what's the addend?</mark>
a; 
The `addend` field in the `Elf64_Rela` struct is used to store the addend for the relocation entry. The `offset` field specifies the location in the object file where the relocation should be performed, while the `type` field specifies the type of relocation to be performed (e.g., 32-bit PC-relative, 32-bit absolute).

Here's an example to illustrate how the addend is used to compute the final value of a reference. Suppose we have the following C code:
```c
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

int main() {
    int c = a + b + 5;
    return 0;
}
```
When this code is compiled and linked, the linker needs to resolve the references to the `a` and `b` variables in the `main()` function. Suppose that the linker has determined that the address of the `a` variable is 0x1000, and the address of the `b` variable is 0x2000.

The `c` variable is computed as the sum of `a`, `b`, and 5, so the compiled code contains an instruction to add the values of `a` and `b`, and then add the constant value 5. The instruction might look something like this:
```c
movl a, %eax    # Move the value of a into the %eax register
addl b, %eax    # Add the value of b to the %eax register
addl $5, %eax   # Add the constant value 5 to the %eax register
movl %eax, c    # Move the value in %eax to the variable c
```
The linker generates a relocation entry for the reference to `a` in the `movl a, %eax` instruction. The `offset` field of the relocation entry specifies the location of the reference (e.g., the offset from the start of the section). The `symbol` field specifies the symbol that the reference refers to (e.g., the symbol table index for `a`). The `type` field specifies the type of relocation to be performed (e.g., 32-bit absolute). Finally, the `addend` field stores the constant value 0, since no addend is required for an absolute reference.

In the case of the `addl $5, %eax` instruction, the constant value 5 is encoded directly in the instruction, so no relocation entry is needed. However, if the constant value were stored in a separate memory location (e.g., if `int d = 5;` were defined), then a relocation entry would be needed to add the value of `d` to the instruction. In this case, the `addend` field of the relocation entry would store the constant value 5.

### Example with all the options
Suppose we have a hypothetical ELF file with two sections named `.text` and `.data`. The `.text` section contains machine code instructions, while the `.data` section contains data. One of the instructions in the `.text` section is a `mov` instruction that accesses a value defined in the `.data` section. However, the value's address is not known at the time of linking, so a relocation entry is added to the `.rela.text` section to allow the value's address to be resolved at runtime.

Here is an example of what the sections might contain:
```c
Section .text:
0000:  48 8b 05 00 00 00 00  mov    0x0(%rip),%rax
0007:  c3                    retq

Section .data:
0000:  00 00 00 2a           some_data: .long 42
```

In this example, the `mov` instruction at offset 0x0 in the `.text` section loads the 4-byte value located at offset 0x0 in the `.data` section into the `%rax` register. The offset `0x0(%rip)` is a relative offset that specifies the address of the value to be loaded.

However, at the time of linking, the address of `some_data` is not yet known, so a relocation entry is added to the `.rela.text` section to allow the address to be resolved at runtime. The relocation entry might look like this:

```c
Section .rela.text:
0000:  00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0010:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```
In this example, the `offset` field in the `Elf64_Rela` structure is 0x0, which means that the relocation entry refers to the first instruction in the `.text` section. The `type` field is 1, which means that this is a `R_X86_64_32` relocation. The `symbol` field is 0xc, which means that the relocation refers to the symbol `some_data` in the `.data` section. Finally, the `addend` field is 0x0, which means that no additional constant needs to be added to the relocated symbol value.

When the ELF file is loaded into memory at runtime, the loader will use the information in the relocation entry to modify the `mov` instruction so that it references the correct memory location of `some_data`. The loader will calculate the address of `some_data` using the symbol table and will update the `mov` instruction with the correct relative offset. The modified `mov` instruction might look like this:
```c
Section .text (after relocation):
0000:  48 8b 05 0e 00 00 00  mov    0xe(%rip),%rax
0007:  c3                    retq
```
In this example, the relative offset `0x0e(%rip)` is used to access the address of `some_data`. The value of `some_data` is loaded into the `%rax` register, and the program can continue executing.

In summary, the `offset` field in the `Elf64_Rela` structure specifies the location in a section's data where a relocation needs to be applied. When the ELF file is loaded into memory at runtime, the loader will use this information, along with the `type`, `symbol`, and `addend` fields in the relocation entry, to modify the section data as needed to correctly reference symbols defined in other sections or files.

In the example above, the `offset` field specifies the location of the `mov` instruction in the `.text` section that needs to be modified. The loader will use the `symbol` field to determine the address of the `some_data` symbol in the `.data` section and will calculate the appropriate relative offset to update the instruction with the correct memory address. This allows the program to correctly access the value defined in the `.data` section even though its address was not known at link time.

The `offset` field is just one of several fields in the `Elf64_Rela` structure that are used to specify a relocation. Other fields such as `type` and `symbol` are used to specify the type of relocation to be performed and the symbol whose value needs to be substituted into the relocated section data. Together, these fields provide the information necessary for the linker or loader to correctly apply the relocation and enable the program to access symbols defined in other sections or files.


## 7.7.2  Relocating Symbol References

read it

-------------------------------------------_code/link/main-relo.d_

```c

1	0000000000000000 <main>:
2	0: 4883ec08		sub		$0x8, %rsp
3	4: be 02 00 00 00	mov		$0x2, %esi

8	13: 4883c408		add		$0x8, %rsp
9	17:c3			retq
```

-------------------------------------------_code/link/main-relo.d_
This code is for the `main` function, which has three instructions:

1.  `sub $0x8, %rsp`: This subtracts 8 bytes from the stack pointer (%rsp), effectively reserving space for two 32-bit variables on the stack.
    
2.  `mov $0x2, %esi`: This moves the value 2 into the %esi register. %esi is used to pass the second argument to the `sum` function.
    
3.  `mov $0x0, %edi`: This moves the address of the `array` symbol into the %edi register. %edi is used to pass the first argument to the `sum` function.
    

Before we talk about the relocation entries, let's take a closer look at the `mov` instructions. In instruction 4, we see that the address of the `array` symbol is moved into the %edi register. This means that the `array` symbol is a global variable that is defined somewhere else in the program. In instruction 5, we see a relocation entry that tells the linker to replace the 32-bit value at the address `a` with the absolute address of the `array` symbol. This is necessary because the address of the `array` symbol is not known at compile time. The linker will resolve this relocation at link time by replacing the 32-bit value with the actual address of the `array` symbol.

In instruction 6, we see a call to the `sum` function. The `sum` function is also a global symbol that is defined somewhere else in the program. In instruction 7, we see a relocation entry that tells the linker to replace the 32-bit value at the address `f` with the PC-relative address of the `sum` symbol. This means that the linker will compute the relative offset from the instruction pointer to the `sum` symbol and replace the 32-bit value with that offset. This is necessary because the absolute address of the `sum` symbol is not known at compile time, but the relative offset is.

Finally, in instruction 8, we see that the stack pointer is adjusted to free the space that was reserved for the variables. And in instruction 9, we see a return instruction.

To summarize, the relocation entries are instructions that tell the linker how to resolve references to global symbols that are defined elsewhere in the program. In this case, the `array` symbol is referenced using a 32-bit absolute address, and the `sum` symbol is referenced using a 32-bit PC-relative address. The linker will resolve these relocations at link time by replacing the 32-bit values with the actual addresses or offsets of the symbols.

q; so `a` is undetermined right?
a; Yes, that's correct. The `a` label in the disassembly listing is just a symbolic name that was assigned to the address of the relocation entry for the `array` symbol for reference purposes. The actual address of the relocation entry is determined by the linker when it processes the object file, and it may be different from the address shown in the disassembly listing.

The linker will use the information in the relocation entry to determine the actual address where the reference to the `array` symbol should be resolved. The address that is used will depend on the layout of the program in memory, and it may be different each time the program is loaded.

### relocating the PC-relative reference in the call instruction 

The call instruction in line 6 of the disassembly listing is:
`6	e: e8 00 00 00 00	callq		13 <main+0x13>		sum()

This instruction contains a 32-bit relative offset to the `sum` function, which is stored as a placeholder in the instruction itself. The linker needs to resolve this offset to the actual address of the `sum` function when it links the object file with other object files to form an executable.

The relocation entry for the `sum` symbol, shown in line 7 of the disassembly listing, tells the linker to modify the 32-bit PC-relative reference starting at offset `0xf` so that it will point to the `sum` function at runtime.

The relocation entry has four fields:

-   `r.offset = 0xf`: This is the offset of the placeholder in the call instruction where the PC-relative reference is stored.
    
-   `r.symbol = sum`: This is the name of the symbol that the PC-relative reference should point to at runtime.
    
-   `r.type = R_X86_64_PC32`: This is the type of relocation that should be applied to the reference. It tells the linker to modify the 32-bit PC-relative offset in the call instruction.
    
-   `r.addend = -4`: This is an addend that should be applied to the PC-relative offset when the reference is resolved.
    

To resolve the reference, the linker needs to determine the actual address of the `sum` function at runtime. In this example, the linker has determined that `ADDR(sum) = 0x4004e8`.

The linker first computes the runtime address of the reference, as follows:
```c
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
        = 0x4004d0 + 0xf
        = 0x4004df
```

Here, `ADDR(s)` is the address of the call instruction, which is `0x4004d0`. The `r.offset` is `0xf`, which is the offset of the placeholder for the PC-relative reference in the call instruction.

Next, the linker updates the reference so that it points to the `sum` function at runtime, as follows:
```c
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr)
        = (unsigned) (0x4004e8 + (-4) - 0x4004df)
        = (unsigned) 0x5
```

Here, `*refptr` is a pointer to the location in memory where the placeholder for the PC-relative reference is stored. The linker computes the difference between the address of the `sum` function and the runtime address of the reference (`ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr`), and stores this difference in the location pointed to by `refptr`. This difference is `0x5`, which is the relative offset from the call instruction to the `sum` function.

Finally, the call instruction is updated to contain the actual PC-relative offset to the `sum` function, as follows:
``4004de: e8 05 00 00 00	callq 4004e8 <sum>	sum()

Here, the relative offset to the `sum` function is `0x5`, which is the difference between the address of the `sum` function and the runtime address of the reference. This updated call instruction will correctly call the `sum` function at runtime.

At runtime, when the CPU encounters the call instruction, it pushes the address of the next instruction onto the stack and updates the program counter (PC) to point to the address of the `sum` function.

When the CPU executes the call instruction, the following steps occur:

1.  The address of the instruction immediately following the call instruction (which is `0x4004e3`) is pushed onto the stack.
    
2.  The PC is updated to point to the address of the `sum` function, which is calculated by adding the relative offset `0x5` to the address of the instruction immediately following the call instruction:
   `PC ← PC + 0x5 = 0x4004e3 + 0x5 = 0x4004e8

3. The CPU starts executing the instructions at the address pointed to by the updated PC, which is the first instruction of the `sum` function.
    

By pushing the return address onto the stack before updating the PC, the CPU ensures that it can return to the correct location in the main function after the `sum` function has completed.

The relocation process ensures that the call instruction is correctly linked to the `sum` function, even though the actual address of the `sum` function was not known at compile time. The linker is able to calculate the correct relative offset from the call instruction to the `sum` function, and update the call instruction to contain this offset, allowing the program to call the `sum` function at runtime.

###  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Relocating Absolute References</mark>
In the `mov` instruction in line 4 of the disassembly listing, the address of the `array` symbol is loaded into the `%edi` register using a 32-bit immediate value, which is stored as a placeholder in the instruction itself.

The relocation entry for the `array` symbol, shown in line 5 of the disassembly listing, tells the linker to modify the 32-bit absolute reference starting at offset `0xa` so that it will point to the first byte of the `array` symbol at runtime.

The relocation entry has four fields:

-   `r.offset = 0xa`: This is the offset of the placeholder in the `mov` instruction where the absolute reference is stored.
    
-   `r.symbol = array`: This is the name of the symbol that the absolute reference should point to at runtime.
    
-   `r.type = R_X86_64_32`: This is the type of relocation that should be applied to the reference. It tells the linker to modify the 32-bit absolute address in the `mov` instruction.
    
-   `r.addend = 0`: This is an addend that should be applied to the absolute address when the reference is resolved.
    

To resolve the reference, the linker needs to determine the actual address of the `array` symbol at runtime. In this example, the linker has determined that `ADDR(array) = 0x601018`.

The linker updates the reference using line 13 of the algorithm in Figure 7.10, which simply adds the addend to the address of the symbol to obtain the actual address of the symbol:
```c
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend)
        = (unsigned) (0x601018 + 0)
        = (unsigned) (0x601018)
```
Here, `*refptr` is a pointer to the location in memory where the placeholder for the absolute reference is stored. The linker stores the actual address of the `array` symbol (`0x601018`) in the location pointed to by `refptr`, which replaces the placeholder in the `mov` instruction.

Finally, the `mov` instruction is updated to contain the actual 32-bit absolute address of the `array` symbol, as follows:
`4004d9: bf 18 10 60 00  mov $0x601018, %edi    %edi = &array

Here, the 32-bit absolute address of the `array` symbol is `0x601018`, which is the actual address of the `array` symbol at runtime. This updated `mov` instruction will correctly load the address of the `array` symbol into the `%edi` register at runtime.

The relocation process ensures that the `mov` instruction is correctly linked to the `array` symbol, even though the actual address of the `array` symbol was not known at compile time. The linker is able to compute the actual address of the `array` symbol and update the `mov` instruction to contain this address, allowing the program to correctly reference the `array` symbol at runtime.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; how is relocating relative and absolute references different?</mark>
a; Relocating relative and absolute references is different because they require different relocation strategies.

Relative references, also known as PC-relative references, are used to refer to a location in memory that is a fixed distance away from the current instruction pointer (IP) or program counter (PC). In other words, they specify a memory location relative to the address of the instruction that references it.

To relocate a relative reference, the linker needs to compute the actual distance between the referenced location and the location of the instruction that references it. This distance is called the relocation offset, and it is used to modify the instruction so that it points to the correct memory location at runtime.

In the case of PC-relative references, the relocation offset is typically stored as a 32-bit signed integer value that is added to the current IP or PC to obtain the actual memory address at runtime.

In contrast, absolute references specify a fixed memory address that is independent of the current IP or PC. These references are typically used to refer to global variables or functions that are defined in other modules or libraries.

To relocate an absolute reference, the linker needs to determine the actual memory address of the referenced symbol at runtime. This address is then used to replace the placeholder value in the instruction that references the symbol, allowing the program to correctly reference the symbol at runtime.

In the case of absolute references, the linker typically stores the actual memory address of the referenced symbol in the instruction itself, replacing the placeholder value that was used during assembly.

q; what's an example?
a; 
```c
int main() {
    int array[2] = {1, 2};
    int result = sum(array[0], array[1]);
    return 0;
}
```
The `array` variable is an array of integers, and its address is used as an argument to the `sum` function. The `sum` function is defined in a separate module, and its address needs to be resolved at link time.

To generate the object file for `main.c`, the C compiler generates assembly code that includes the `mov` instruction in line 4:
```c
4: bf 00 00 00 00	mov $0x0, %edi		%edi = &array
5: e8 00 00 00 00	callq 0 <sum>		sum()
```
The `mov` instruction loads the address of the `array` variable into the `%edi` register, and the `callq` instruction calls the `sum` function.

The object file for `main.c` contains relocation entries that tell the linker to modify the `mov` and `callq` instructions to use the correct addresses at runtime. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The relocation entry for the `array` variable is of type `R_X86_64_32`, which means it is an absolute reference</mark>. The relocation entry for the `sum` function is of type `R_X86_64_PC32`, which means it is a PC-relative reference.

When the linker processes the object files for `main.c` and `sum.c`, it resolves the references to the `array` variable and the `sum` function. It then modifies the `mov` instruction to use the actual address of the `array` variable, and it modifies the `callq` instruction to use a PC-relative address that jumps to the beginning of the `sum` function.

At runtime, the `mov` instruction loads the correct address of the `array` variable, and the `callq` instruction jumps to the correct location of the `sum` function. The relocation process ensures that the program can correctly reference the `array` variable and the `sum` function, even though their actual addresses were not known at compile time.

a;<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> In x86-64 architectur</mark>e, `R_X86_64_32` is a relocation type that is used for 32-bit absolute references. This means that the reference is an offset from the start of the program's data segment (or a section that has been assigned a virtual memory address), rather than a relative offset from the current program counter or instruction pointer.

In the case of the `array` variable, the C compiler generates a `mov` instruction that loads the address of the `array` variable into the `%edi` register. The instruction includes a placeholder value of `0x00000000`, which is the default value used for 32-bit absolute references.

The linker sees the relocation entry for the `array` variable and uses it to modify the `mov` instruction with the actual address of the `array` variable. The linker determines the actual address of the `array` variable by calculating its offset from the start of the program's data segment (or a section that has been assigned a virtual memory address).

Once the linker has modified the `mov` instruction with the actual address of the `array` variable, the program can correctly reference the `array` variable at runtime.

here's an example that illustrates how a 32-bit absolute reference works in x86-64 architecture:

Suppose we have the following code in a C program:
```c
extern int foo;

void bar() {
    int x = foo + 1;
}
```
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The `bar` function references the `foo` variable, which is defined in another module. The `foo` variable has an absolute address that needs to be resolved at link time.</mark>

When the C compiler generates assembly code for the `bar` function, it includes the following instruction:
`movl foo(%rip), %eax

This instruction loads the value of the `foo` variable into the `%eax` register. The instruction includes a placeholder value of `foo(%rip)`, which is a 32-bit absolute reference to the `foo` variable.

The `(%rip)` part of the reference means that the reference is an offset relative to the current program counter. Specifically, it is an offset from the next instruction to be executed, which is known as the "instruction pointer" or "program counter".

In the case of a 32-bit absolute reference, the offset is added to the base address of the data segment to obtain the actual address of the referenced variable. The data segment is a section of memory that contains static and global variables, and it is located at a fixed address in virtual memory.

When the linker processes the object files for the program, it resolves the reference to the `foo` variable and modifies the `movl` instruction with the actual address of the `foo` variable. The linker determines the actual address of the `foo` variable by adding the offset in the reference to the base address of the data segment.

Once the linker has modified the `movl` instruction with the actual address of the `foo` variable, the program can correctly reference the `foo` variable at runtime.

So, in summary, a 32-bit absolute reference in x86-64 architecture is an offset from the current program counter that is added to the base address of the data segment to obtain the actual address of the referenced variable. The linker uses the relocation entry to modify the instruction with the actual address of the referenced variable.

In the example I gave, the `foo` variable is defined in another module (i.e., a different source file that is compiled separately), which means that its address is not known at compile time.

When the compiler generates the assembly code for the `bar` function, it includes a reference to the `foo` variable with a placeholder value. The placeholder value is essentially a hint to the linker that the actual address of the `foo` variable needs to be filled in at link time.

At link time, the linker processes all the object files for the program and resolves all the undefined symbols (e.g., variables or functions that are referenced but not defined in the current object file) by assigning them addresses in memory.

For the `foo` variable, the linker assigns an actual address to the variable and uses that address to fill in the placeholder value in the `movl` instruction generated by the compiler. This is known as relocation, and it is the process by which the linker modifies the binary code to include the actual addresses of all the symbols that are referenced in the program.

the `foo` variable is an absolute reference because the address of the `foo` variable is not relative to the current program counter or instruction pointer.

Instead, it is an absolute address that is relative to the beginning of the program's data segment. The data segment is a section of memory that contains static and global variables, and it is located at a fixed address in virtual memory.

When the compiler generates the assembly code for the `bar` function, it includes a reference to the `foo` variable as an offset from the base address of the data segment. The offset is added to the base address at runtime to obtain the actual address of the `foo` variable.

The relocation entry for an absolute reference is different from that of a relative reference. For an absolute reference, the relocation entry typically includes the symbol name (e.g., `foo`), the offset of the reference from the beginning of the section (e.g., 0x8), and the relocation type (e.g., `R_X86_64_32`). The relocation type specifies that the linker should modify the reference using a 32-bit absolute address.

1.  Consider the call to function `swap` in object file `m.o` 
    
    ```
    9: e8 00 00 00 00	callq	e <main+0xe>	swap()
    ```
    
    with the following relocation entry:
    
    ```
    r.offset = 0xa
    r.symbol = swap
    r.type = R_X86_64_PC32
    r.addend = -4
    ```
    
    Now suppose that the linker relocates `.text` in `m.o` to address `0x4004d0` and swap to address `0x4004e8`. Then what is the value of the relocated reference to `swap` in the `callq` instruction?

a; 
1.  Given the relocation entry for the call to `swap`, we know that the reference to `swap` is PC-relative and is located at offset 0xa in the `callq` instruction.
    We know that the reference to `swap` is PC-relative and is located at offset 0xa in the `callq` instruction because of the type of the relocation entry for the reference, which is `R_X86_64_PC32`. This type of relocation is used for PC-relative references, meaning that the address of the target is computed relative to the address of the instruction that contains the reference. The `offset` field of the relocation entry specifies the offset of the reference from the start of the section containing the instruction, which in this case is the `.text` section of the `m.o` object file. The offset is given as 0xa, which means that the reference is located 10 bytes from the start of the `.text` section, at the position where the `callq` instruction starts.
2.  We're also given that the linker has relocated the `.text` section in `m.o` to address 0x4004d0, and that the address of the `swap` function is 0x4004e8.
    
3.  Using the algorithm in Figure 7.10, the linker computes the run-time address of the reference by adding the offset to the address of the `callq` instruction. In this case, the run-time address of the reference is:
```c
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
= 0x4004d0 + 0xa
= 0x4004da
```
Here, `s` refers to the start address of the `.text` section, which we know is the same as the address of `m.o`.

You need to compute the run-time address of the reference, denoted by `refaddr`, because it is the address where the target function will be located at run-time, when the program is executed. The relocation entry for the reference tells the linker to modify the reference so that it will point to the correct address at run-time, by adding the offset to the start of the section containing the instruction, which gives the run-time address of the reference. This is necessary because the addresses of the functions and variables in the program are not known at link-time, but only at run-time, when the program is loaded into memory.

the call instruction to `swap()` is located in the `.text` section. The relocation entry for this instruction specifies that the reference to `swap()` is PC-relative, which means it is an offset from the current program counter or instruction pointer.

To compute the correct runtime address of this reference, the linker needs to know the address of the `.text` section, since the offset of the reference is relative to the start of this section. This is why `ADDR(s) = ADDR(.text) = 0x4004d0` is given in the problem statement.

Once the linker knows the address of the `.text` section, it can compute the runtime address of the reference by adding the `r.offset` (which is the offset of the reference relative to the start of the instruction) to the start address of the `.text` section. The resulting value is the runtime address of the instruction with the reference.

The runtime address of the reference is used to update the reference in the instruction, so that it points to the correct location of `swap()` in memory at runtime.

4. Next, the linker updates the reference to `swap` by subtracting the run-time address of the reference from the sum of the address of `swap` and the addend in the relocation entry. In this case, the update is:
```c
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr)
= (unsigned) (0x4004e8 + (-4) - 0x4004da)
= (unsigned) (0xa)
```
Here, `r.symbol` refers to the symbol being referenced by the relocation entry, which is `swap`. The addend is -4, which means that we need to subtract 4 from the final value of the reference. The resulting value of 0xa is the offset from the `callq` instruction to the start of the `swap` function, and will be used by the CPU to compute the address of the `swap` function at run time.
    
Finally, the updated reference is used to generate the relocated form of the `callq` instruction in the executable object file, which has the value:
``4004d9: e8 0a 00 00 00  callq  4004e8 <swap>`
This instruction will be used at run time to transfer control to the `swap` function.
