The top of the visualization shows the top of the user address space, which is the region of memory that is used by programs that run in user mode. The visualization shows three different regions of memory in this space: `Program 1`, `Program 2`, and `Shared Libs`.

`Program 1` and `Program 2` represent two running programs, each with its own code, data, and heap segments. These segments are shown as blocks of memory within the user address space. The `Data` segment contains the program's initialized and uninitialized global and static variables. The `Heap` segment is used to dynamically allocate memory during the program's execution.

The `Shared Libs` region represents the shared libraries that are used by both programs. These are libraries that contain code that can be shared between multiple programs, which can help reduce the memory footprint of the system.

Below the `Shared Libs` region is the `Heap` segment, which grows upward as memory is dynamically allocated during program execution.

The `Data` segment is located below the `Heap` segment and contains the program's initialized and uninitialized global and static variables.

The `Code` segment is located below the `Data` segment and contains the program's executable instructions. The visualization shows the default starting address for the `Code` segment on Linux x86-64 systems, which is `0x400000`. However, as I mentioned earlier, the linker or compiler can change the starting address of the `Code` segment.

There is a gap between the `Data` and `Code` segments due to alignment requirements on the `.data` segment, which is shown in the visualization.

Below the user address space is the kernel address space, which is the region of memory used by the kernel. The visualization shows the `Stack` segment, which grows downward from the top of the user address space, as well as some unused memory.
- - -
`linux> ./prog`
- the shell asumes that prog is an executable object file which it runs for us by invoking some memory-resident operating system code known as the `loader`
-  Any Linux program can invoke the loader by calling the `execve` function
- The loader copies the program's code and data from disk to memory and then runs it by jumping to the first instruction (entry point). This process is called loading.

q; on linux x86-64 systems - which address does the code segment begin at?
a; 0x400000. This is known as the "text segment" or "code segment" and it is reserved for the program's executable instructions.

The reason for starting at this address is largely historical. Back in the early days of computing, it was common for the operating system to reserve the first several hundred kilobytes of memory for itself. As a result, the code for programs would be loaded starting at a certain offset from the beginning of memory. On modern systems, this offset is typically set to `0x400000`, although the exact value may vary depending on the operating system and system configuration.

It's worth noting that the specific address where the code segment starts can be changed by the linker or compiler by using command-line options or by specifying the segment's starting address explicitly in the program's source code. However, `0x400000` is the default value that is used if no other starting address is specified.

q; where does the data segment start?
a; after the code segment
