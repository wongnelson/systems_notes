Q: What is the key purpose of shared libraries?
A: The key purpose of shared libraries is to allow multiple running processes to share the same library code in memory and save memory resources.

Q: How can multiple processes share a single copy of a program?
A: By compiling the code segments of shared modules as position-independent code (PIC), which can be loaded anywhere in memory without requiring modification by the linker.

Q: What problems arise if a dedicated chunk of the address space is assigned to each shared library?
A: This approach is inefficient in its use of address space and difficult to manage. It could potentially lead to fragmentation and management headaches as **it would be difficult to keep the address space from fragmenting into lots of small unused but unusable holes.**

why ^?
In the approach of assigning a dedicated chunk of the address space to each shared library, the address space would be divided into smaller regions that correspond to the size of the allocated chunks. As more chunks are allocated, the available address space gets divided into smaller and smaller regions, leaving small "holes" of unused and unusable address space between the allocated chunks.

Over time, as shared libraries are added, modified, and removed, the size and number of allocated chunks may change, making it difficult to manage the available address space. To ensure that chunks do not overlap, administrators would need to carefully track and manage the allocation of each chunk, which could become time-consuming and error-prone as more chunks are added and modified.

Additionally, if a shared library is modified and its size grows beyond the allocated chunk size, it may no longer fit within its assigned chunk, requiring a new chunk to be allocated. Similarly, if a new library is added and there is no available space left in the existing chunks, a new chunk would need to be created to accommodate the new library.

All of these management issues could result in fragmentation of the available address space into lots of small, unused, and unusable holes. This fragmentation could make it difficult for new libraries to find enough contiguous space to be loaded, which can lead to more fragmentation and further management headaches.

Q: How can modern systems avoid these problems?
A: Modern systems compile the code segments of shared modules as position-independent code (PIC), which can be loaded anywhere in memory without requiring modification by the linker.

Q: What is position-independent code (PIC)?
A: Position-independent code (PIC) is code that can be loaded without requiring any relocations. It allows a single copy of a shared module's code segment to be shared by an unlimited number of processes.

Q: How can shared libraries be compiled as PIC?
A: To generate PIC code, users can direct GNU compilation systems to use the -fpic option to gcc, which is required for shared libraries to be compiled.

Q: Do each process still get its own copy of the read/write data segment?
A: Yes, each process still gets its own copy of the read/write data segment.

Q: Do references to symbols in the same executable object module require special treatment to be PIC?
A: No, references to symbols in the same executable object module do not require special treatment to be PIC.

Q: What special techniques are required for references to external procedures and global variables that are defined by shared modules?
A: Special techniques are required for references to external procedures and global variables that are defined by shared modules, which are described in the following section.

q; how might the PIC look like?
a; 
Position-independent code (PIC) is a code format that can be executed regardless of its absolute memory location. PIC code can be loaded into any memory location and still run correctly, without requiring any modifications to the code itself. One way to implement PIC is through the use of a global offset table (GOT), which is a table of pointers that is used to reference global data objects. Here is an example of how a GOT might look like in ASCII art:

```c
|--------------------------------|
|  Global Offset Table (GOT)     |
|--------------------------------|
| Object 1: 0x00000000           |
| Object 2: 0x00000008           |
| Object 3: 0x00000010           |
| ...                            |
| Object n: 0x000000xx           |
|--------------------------------|
```

In this example, the GOT is a table of 8-byte pointers, with each entry corresponding to a global data object that is referenced by the object module. Each entry in the GOT is initially set to a placeholder value of 0x00000000, and a relocation record is generated for each entry in the GOT.

At load time, the dynamic linker reads the relocation records for each entry in the GOT, calculates the absolute address of the corresponding global data object, and updates the GOT entry with the absolute address. This process effectively relocates each GOT entry with the absolute address of the corresponding global data object.

The use of a GOT enables the code to be loaded into different memory locations and still run correctly, as the absolute address of each global data object is not known until load time. The GOT ensures that each reference to a global data object is resolved correctly, regardless of the actual memory location of the code and data segments.

Overall, the use of a global offset table is a practical implementation of PIC that enables code to be loaded into different memory locations and still run correctly, without requiring any modifications to the code itself.

### PIC function calls

**Q: Why is it difficult for the compiler to predict the run-time address of a function that is defined by a shared library?** 
A: When a program calls a function that is defined by a shared library, the compiler has no way of predicting the run-time address of the function, since the shared module that defines it could be loaded anywhere at run time. This is because the absolute memory location of the shared library is not known until load time.

**Q: What is lazy binding, and how does it help solve the issue of unpredictable run-time addresses?** A: Lazy binding is an interesting technique used by GNU compilation systems to solve the issue of unpredictable run-time addresses of functions defined by shared libraries. Lazy binding defers the binding of each procedure address until the first time the procedure is called. By deferring the resolution of a function's address until it is actually called, the dynamic linker can avoid unnecessary relocations at load time.

**Q: Why is lazy binding useful for a typical application program?** 
A: A typical application program will call only a handful of the hundreds or thousands of functions exported by a shared library such as libc.so. By deferring the resolution of a function's address until it is actually called, lazy binding can significantly reduce the number of relocations that need to be performed at load time, improving the load time performance of the program.

**Q: How is lazy binding implemented using the global offset table (GOT) and procedure linkage table (PLT)?** 
A: Lazy binding is implemented using a compact yet somewhat complex interaction between the global offset table (GOT) and the procedure linkage table (PLT). If an object module calls any functions that are defined in shared libraries, then it has its own GOT and PLT. The GOT is a table of pointers that is used to reference global data objects, while the PLT is a table of stub functions that are used to call shared library functions.

When a shared library function is first called, the procedure linkage table (PLT) entry is called. The PLT entry checks the corresponding GOT entry to see if it has already been resolved. If it has not been resolved, the PLT entry calls the dynamic linker to resolve the address and update the GOT entry. Once the GOT entry has been updated, the PLT entry jumps to the shared library function.

**Q: Why is lazy binding a practical implementation of position-independent code (PIC)?** 
A: Lazy binding is a practical implementation of position-independent code (PIC) because it enables code to be loaded into different memory locations and still run correctly, without requiring any modifications to the code itself. By deferring the resolution of function addresses until they are actually called, lazy binding reduces the number of relocations that need to be performed at load time, improving the load time performance of the program.
