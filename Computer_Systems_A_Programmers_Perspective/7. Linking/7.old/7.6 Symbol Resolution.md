<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; how does the llinker resolve symbol references?</mark>
a; by associating each reference with exactly one symbol definition from the symbol tables of its input relocatable object files

Consider the following example to illustrate how the linker resolves symbol references:

Suppose you have two relocatable object files, `file1.o` and `file2.o`, and each file defines one symbol.
```c
// file1.o
int g_counter = 0;

// file2.o
extern int g_counter;
void increment_counter() {
  g_counter++;
}
```
In this example, `file1.o` defines the symbol `g_counter`, which is an integer variable with an initial value of 0. `file2.o` defines the symbol `increment_counter`, which is a function that increments the value of `g_counter`. `file2.o` also has an external reference to `g_counter`, which means that it is using the symbol defined in another object file.

When the linker combines `file1.o` and `file2.o` to create an executable or shared library, it will resolve the symbol reference in `file2.o` to the symbol definition in `file1.o`. The linker will associate the symbol reference with the symbol definition by updating the address of the symbol in `file2.o` to point to the symbol in `file1.o`.

After linking, the symbol table for the executable or shared library will look something like this:
```c
Index Name                 Type         Value    Size    Section
--------------------------------------------------------------
1     g_counter            Data         0x1000  4       .data
2     increment_counter    Function     0x2000  0x10    .text
```

In this example, the linker has resolved the symbol reference in `file2.o` to the symbol definition in `file1.o`, and has created a symbol table for the executable or shared library that contains both symbols. The `Value` column gives the address of each symbol, and the `Section` column gives the section where each symbol is defined. The `increment_counter` function can now access the `g_counter` symbol and increment its value, because the linker has resolved the symbol reference and associated it with the symbol definitio

q; When a reference is made to a local symbol that is defined within the same module as the reference, symbol resolution is straightforward. why?
a; 
because local symbols are only visible within the object file in which they are defined, and the compiler ensures that there is only one definition of each local symbol per module.

A local symbol is a symbol that has local scope, meaning it is only visible within the object file in which it is defined. Local symbols are typically used for symbols that are only needed within the same module, such as static variables or functions.

```c
// file1.c
static int g_counter = 0;

void increment_counter() {
  g_counter++;
}

int main() {
  increment_counter();
  return 0;
}
```
In this example, `file1.c` defines a local symbol `g_counter`, which is a static variable with an initial value of 0. The `increment_counter` function increments the value of `g_counter`. The `main` function calls the `increment_counter` function, which references the local symbol `g_counter`.

Since `g_counter` is defined in the same module as the reference, symbol resolution is straightforward. The compiler ensures that there is only one definition of `g_counter` per module, and that the reference to `g_counter` in the `increment_counter` function is resolved to the definition in the same module. The compiler also ensures that static local variables, such as `g_counter`, have unique names to avoid name collisions with other symbols in the same module.

In this example, the symbol resolution for the local symbol `g_counter` is straightforward because it is defined in the same module as the reference, and the compiler ensures that there is only one definition of the symbol per module and that the symbol has a unique name.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; Resolving references to global symbols can be more complex compared to local symbols. why?</mark>
a; When the compiler encounters a symbol, such as a variable or function name, that is not defined within the current module, it assumes that it is defined in another module. The compiler then generates an entry in the linker symbol table and leaves it for the linker to resolve.

If the linker is unable to find a definition for the referenced symbol in any of its input modules, it will display an error message that may be difficult to understand, and it will terminate the linking process.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; why is symbol resolution for global symbols tricky?</mark>
a; multiple object modules might define global symbols with the same name
