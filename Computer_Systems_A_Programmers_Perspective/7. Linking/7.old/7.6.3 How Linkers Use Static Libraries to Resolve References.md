q; during the symbol resolution phase - what does the linker do with relocatable object files ?
a; the linker scans and archives in the order they appear on the compiler command line, and tracks three sets of data

q; what are the three sets of data?
a; 
1.  The set E of relocatable object files that will be merged to form the executable.
2.  The set U of unresolved symbols (i.e. symbols referred to but not yet defined).
3.  The set D of symbols that have been defined in previous input files.

q; in relation to the three sets, what happens when the linker encounters an object file?
a; it adds it to set E, updates sets U and D to reflect the symbol definitions and references in the file, and moves on to the next input file

q; what happens if the input is an archive?
a; the linker attempts to match the unresolved symbols in set U with the symbols defined by the members of the archive

q; what happens if a match is found?
a; the archive member is added to set E, and sets U and D are updated to reflect the symbol definitions and references in the member.

Here's an example to illustrate the process of adding an archive member to set E and updating sets U and D:

Consider the following sets U and D, and an archive file with two member object files:
```c
Initial sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol1, unresolved_symbol2
Set D: 

Archive file:
  +-------------------+
  | archive file      |
  |    (library.a)    |
  +-------------------+
        |
        v
+----------------+     +----------------+
| member object 1 | ... | member object 2 |
|  (obj1.o)      |     |  (obj2.o)      |
+----------------+     +----------------+
        |                 |
        v                 v
+----------------+  +----------------+
| symbol1        |  | symbol2        |
+----------------+  +----------------+
        |                 |
        v                 v
+----------------+  +----------------+
| definition1    |  | definition2    |
+----------------+  +----------------+
```
Suppose that the linker finds a match between `unresolved_symbol1` and `symbol1`, defined by `member object 1`. After finding this match, the linker adds `member object 1` to set E, and updates sets U and D as follows:
```
Updated sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol2
Set D: definition1

Set E: obj1.o (member object 1 from the archive file)
```
As you can see, the linker has removed `unresolved_symbol1` from set U because it has been resolved by the definition of `symbol1` in `member object 1`. The definition of `symbol1` has also been added to set D, so that the linker can keep track of all symbols that have been defined so far. And finally, `member object 1` has been added to set E, so that it will be included in the final executable.

The linker will continue this process until all unresolved symbols in set U have been resolved and set U is empty.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; what happens if a member object file is not contained in set E?</mark>
a; Any member object files not contained in set E are discarded, and the linker moves on to the next input file

Example:
Consider the following sets U and D, and an archive file with three member object files:
```c
Initial sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol1, unresolved_symbol2
Set D: 

Archive file:
  +-------------------+
  | archive file      |
  |    (library.a)    |
  +-------------------+
        |
        v
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
| member object 1 | ... | member object 2 | ... | member object 3 |
|  (obj1.o)      |     |  (obj2.o)      |     |  (obj3.o)      |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
        |                 |                    |
        v                 v                    v
+----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
| symbol1        |  | symbol2        |  | symbol3        |
+----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
        |                 |                    |
        v                 v                    v
+----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
| definition1    |  | definition2    |  | definition3    |
+----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
```

Suppose that the linker finds a match between `unresolved_symbol1` and `symbol1`, defined by `member object 1`, but it does not find a match between `unresolved_symbol2` and any of the symbols defined by the members of the archive. After finding this match, the linker adds `member object 1` to set E, and updates sets U and D as follows:

```
Updated sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol2
Set D: definition1

Set E: obj1.o (member object 1 from the archive file)
```

As you can see, `unresolved_symbol1` has been resolved by the definition of `symbol1` in `member object 1`, but `unresolved_symbol2` remains unresolved.

Since `member object 2` and `member object 3` do not define any symbols that resolve references in set U, they are not needed to form the final executable, and the linker discards them and moves on to the next input file:
```
Final sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol2
Set D: definition1

Set E: obj1.o (member object 1 from the archive file)

Discarded members: obj2.o, obj3.o

```

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; what happens if set U isn't empty after all input files have been scanned?</mark>
a; the linker terminates with an error. If set U is empty, the linker merges and relocates the object files in set E to create the output executable file.

## Potential issues

1.  The significance of library and object file order: The order in which libraries and object files appear on the command line when using the GCC compiler on Linux is significant and can have an impact on the success of the linking process. For example:

```c
linux> gcc -static . /libvector.a main2.c
/tmp/cc9XH6Rp.o: In function `main':
/tmp/cc9XH6Rp.o(.text+0x18): undefined reference to `addvec'
```

In this example, the library `/libvector.a` appears before the object file `main2.c`, causing the linker to fail with an undefined reference error.

2. The algorithm used by the linker: The linker scans the relocatable object files and archives on the command line in the order they appear, and maintains sets of relocatable object files, unresolved symbols, and defined symbols. For example, the linker maintains the following sets:

```
Set U: unresolved_symbol1, unresolved_symbol2
Set D: 
Set E: 
```

3. The impact of library order: If a library that defines a symbol appears on the command line before the object file that references that symbol, the reference will not be resolved and linking will fail. For example:

```c
Initial sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol1, unresolved_symbol2
Set D: 

Archive file:
  +-------------------+
  | archive file      |
  |    (library.a)    |
  +-------------------+
        |
        v
+----------------+     +----------------+
| member object 1 | ... | member object 2 |
|  (obj1.o)      |     |  (obj2.o)      |
+----------------+     +----------------+
        |                 |
        v                 v
+----------------+  +----------------+
| symbol1        |  | symbol2        |
+----------------+  +----------------+
        |                 |
        v                 v
+----------------+  +----------------+
| definition1    |  | definition2    |
+----------------+  +----------------+
```
Suppose that the linker finds a match between `unresolved_symbol1` and `symbol1`, defined by `member object 1`. After finding this match, the linker adds `member object 1` to set E and updates sets U and D:
```
Updated sets U and D:

Set U: unresolved_symbol2
Set D: definition1

Set E: obj1.o (member object 1 from the archive file)
```
In this example, the library that defines `symbol1` (`library.a`) was processed before the object file that references `symbol1` (`main2.c`), causing the reference to `symbol1` to be resolved, and the linker to successfully build the final executable.

4. The general rule for library placement: The general rule for library placement is to place them at the end of the command line. If the members of different libraries are independent, in that no member references a symbol defined by another member, then the libraries can be placed at the end of the command line in any order. If, on the other hand, the libraries are not independent, then they must be ordered so that for each symbol s that is referenced externally by a member of an archive, at least one definition of s follows a reference to s on the command line. For example:
   ```linux> gcc foo.c libx.a libz.a liby.a```
   
   In this example, `foo.c` calls functions in `libx.a` and `libz.a` that call functions in `liby.a`. Therefore, `libx.a` and `libz.a` must precede `liby.a` on the command line

5.  Repeating libraries on the command line: Libraries can be repeated on the command line if necessary to satisfy the dependence requirements. For example:
	```linux> gcc foo.c libx.a liby.a libx.a```
 
 In this example, `foo.c` calls a function in `libx.a` that calls a function in `liby.a` that calls a function in `libx.a`. Therefore, `libx.a` must be repeated on the command line to satisfy the dependence requirements.

### 7.3
1.  Let `a` and `b` denote object modules or static libraries in the current directory, and let `a→b` denote that a depends on b, in the sense that b defines a symbol that is referenced by a. For each of the following scenarios, show the minimal command line (i.e., one with the least number of object file and library arguments) that will allow the static linker to resolve all symbol references.
    
    1.  ```
        p.o → libx.a
		
		gcc p.o libx.a
    2.  ```
        p.o → libx.a → liby.a
        gcc p.o libx.a liby.a
    3.  ```
        p.o → libx.a → liby.a and liby.a → libx.a → p.o
        gcc p.o libx.a liby.a libx.a
