- besides dynamic linking in the scenario where the dynamic linker loads and links shared libraries when an application is loaded, just before it executes, it is also possible for an application to request the dynamic linker to load and link shared libraries while the application is running, without having to link in those libraries at compile time.

Linux systems provide a simple interface to the dynamic linker that allows application programs to load and link shared libraries at run time.

```
void *dlopen(const char *filename, int flag);
				Returns: pointer to handle if OK, NULL on error
```
The `dlopen` function loads and links the shared library `filename`. The external symbols in `filename` are resolved using libraries previously opened with the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">RTLD_GLOBAL</mark>` flag

If the current executable was compiled with <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the `-rdynamic` flag</mark>, then its global symbols are also available for symbol resolution. The `flag` argument must include either `RTLD_NOW`, which tells the linker to resolve references to external symbols immediately, or the `RTLD_LAZY` flag, which instructs the linker to defer symbol resolution until code from the library is executed. Either of these values can be ored with the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag.

### RTLD
q; <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark> 
Question: What does RTLD stand for?

Answer: RTLD stands for "run-time dynamic linker loader".

Question: What is the role of the dynamic linker?

Answer: The dynamic linker is a component of the system's loader that loads and links shared libraries into an executable program at runtime. It also resolves the symbols that are referenced by the program and the shared libraries it uses.

Question: What happens when a program is started in context of the dynamic linking?

Answer: When a program is started, the dynamic linker performs the following tasks:

loads the program into memory
maps the program into the process address space
loads any shared libraries that the program requires
maps the shared libraries into the process address space
resolves the symbols that are needed by the program and the shared libraries

Question: What is the RTLD responsible for?

Answer: The RTLD is responsible for managing the loaded shared libraries at runtime. It provides functions such as dlopen(), dlsym(), dlclose(), and dlerror() that enable a program to:

load and link shared libraries
obtain symbols from the shared libraries
close shared libraries when they are no longer needed
report any errors that occur during the process.

#### q; why would you want to use RTLD_GOBAL?
Question: What happens when a shared library is loaded at runtime using the dlopen() function in a Linux system?

Answer: When a shared library is loaded at runtime using the dlopen() function in a Linux system, the symbols defined in that library can be resolved using libraries that were previously loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag.

Question: What is the default behavior when a shared library is loaded with dlopen()?

Answer: By default, when a shared library is loaded with dlopen(), its symbols are only available for symbol resolution to other shared libraries that are loaded after it. This is known as "local" symbol resolution.

Question: What happens when a shared library is loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag?

Answer: When a shared library is loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag using dlopen(), its symbols become available for symbol resolution to all other shared libraries that are loaded, including those that were loaded before it. This is known as "global" symbol resolution.

Question: How does the RTLD_GLOBAL flag affect symbol resolution in a Linux system?

Answer: When a shared library is loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag, its symbols are added to the global symbol table, which can be used for symbol resolution by all shared libraries that are loaded afterward. This can be useful when a shared library needs to reference a symbol that is defined in the main program, or when the program itself needs to load and link shared libraries at runtime.

Question: What are the potential downsides of using the RTLD_GLOBAL flag?

Answer: Using the RTLD_GLOBAL flag can lead to namespace conflicts and make it harder to manage the symbol resolution process. It is generally recommended to use the RTLD_LOCAL flag by default, and only use RTLD_GLOBAL when it is necessary for the program's functionality.

#### q; what's an example of how `RTLD_GLOBAL` can be used for symbol resolution by shared libraries that are loaded later?
a; 
Suppose we have a program `main.c` that defines a function called `foo()` and a shared library `libtest.so` that references `foo()`:
```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void foo() {
    printf("Hello from foo!\n");
}

// libtest.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

void call_foo() {
    void (*foo_ptr)() = dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "foo");
	/**
 the `dlsym()` function is called with the `RTLD_DEFAULT` flag to resolve a symbol that is defined in the main program's dynamic symbol table. The `RTLD_DEFAULT` flag specifies that the lookup should be performed using the default search scope, which includes the dynamic symbol table of the main program as well as all shared libraries that have been loaded with the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag.

If you call `dlsym()` with a specific handle returned by `dlopen()`, it will only search for the symbol in the dynamic symbol table of the shared library identified by that handle, and not in the dynamic symbol table of the main program or other shared libraries that were loaded with `RTLD_GLOBAL`. So if you want to resolve a symbol that is defined in the main program or a shared library that was loaded with `RTLD_GLOBAL`, you need to use `RTLD_DEFAULT` as the handle.
	*/
    if (foo_ptr != NULL) {
        printf("Calling foo from libtest...\n");
        foo_ptr();
    } else {
        printf("Error: symbol foo not found.\n");
    }
}
```
When `libtest.so` is compiled and linked without the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag, it can only resolve symbols from the dynamic symbol table of the shared library itself. So if we compile and link `libtest.so` without `RTLD_GLOBAL` and try to call `foo()` from `libtest.so`, we get an error:
```c
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o libtest.so libtest.c -ldl
$ ./prog
Error: symbol foo not found.
```
However, if we load `libtest.so` at runtime with the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag, its symbols become available for symbol resolution to all other shared libraries that are loaded later. So if we load `libtest.so` with `RTLD_GLOBAL` and call `call_foo()` from `libtest.so`, it can successfully resolve and call `foo()` from `main.c`:
```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void foo() {
    printf("Hello from foo!\n");
}

// libtest.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

void call_foo() {
    void (*foo_ptr)() = dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "foo");
    if (foo_ptr != NULL) {
        printf("Calling foo from libtest...\n");
        foo_ptr();
    } else {
        printf("Error: symbol foo not found.\n");
    }
}

// prog.c
#include <dlfcn.h>

int main() {
    void *handle = dlopen("./libtest.so", RTLD_GLOBAL | RTLD_LAZY);
    if (handle != NULL) {
        printf("Loaded libtest with handle %p.\n", handle);
        void (*call_foo_ptr)() = dlsym(handle, "call_foo");
        if (call_foo_ptr != NULL) {
            printf("Calling call_foo from libtest...\n");
            call_foo_ptr();
        } else {
            printf("Error: symbol call_foo not found.\n");
        }
        dlclose(handle);
    } else {
        printf("Error: failed to load libtest.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o libtest.so libtest.c -ldl
$ gcc -o prog main.c prog.c -ldl
$ ./prog
Loaded libtest with handle 0x7f8d9728c050.
Calling call_foo from libtest...
Calling foo from libtest...
Hello from foo!
```
in this example, `libtest.so` is loaded at runtime with the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag, which makes its symbols, including `foo()`, available for symbol resolution to all other shared libraries that are loaded later. When we call `call_foo()` from `libtest.so`, it successfully resolves and calls

###  rdynamic`
q; <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">red</mark> 
The `-rdynamic` flag is a linker flag that is used when building an executable to include information about all symbols in the program in the dynamic symbol table. This allows the symbols to be resolved at runtime, even if they are not referenced directly in the program.

Here is an example of how a dynamic symbol table might look like in ASCII art:
```c
+--------------------+
|   Dynamic Symbol   |
|       Table        |
+--------------------+
|  Num  |      Name  |
+--------------------+
|  0    |    printf  |
|  1    |     malloc|
|  2    |      free |
|  3    |     dlopen|
|  4    |     dlsym |
|  5    |    dlclose|
|  6    |   dlerror |
|  ...  |      ...  |
+--------------------+
```

This table is typically organized as a list of entries, with each entry containing a symbol's index number (or "num") and name. The index number is used to refer to the symbol within the table, and the name is the actual name of the symbol that can be used for linking purposes.

The number of entries in the dynamic symbol table can vary depending on the number of symbols defined in the shared libraries that are loaded at runtime. Each entry in the table corresponds to a unique symbol in one of the loaded shared libraries.

The dynamic symbol table is used by the dynamic linker to resolve symbols at runtime when they are referenced by the program or shared libraries. When a symbol is referenced, the linker looks up the symbol in the dynamic symbol table to obtain its address and link it to the appropriate function or variable in the program or shared library.

When the `-rdynamic` flag is used, the global symbols of the executable are available for symbol resolution to the shared libraries loaded at runtime with `dlopen()`. This can be useful when a shared library needs to reference a symbol that is defined in the main program, or when the program itself needs to load and link shared libraries at runtime.

However, there are some cases where the `-rdynamic` flag should not be used. For example:

-   Security: Including all symbols in the dynamic symbol table can make it easier for an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the program or its dependencies.
-   Size: Including all symbols in the dynamic symbol table can increase the size of the program and the dynamic symbol table, which can lead to increased memory usage and longer loading times.
-   Name conflicts: If the program includes symbols that have the same name as symbols in a shared library, the dynamic linker may resolve the wrong symbol,

Here are some examples of when you might want to use or not use the `-rdynamic` flag:

Use cases for `-rdynamic`:

-   Building a plugin system where the main program and plugins need to reference each other's symbols at runtime.
-   Building a dynamic loader or interpreter where the program needs to load and execute code from external shared libraries at runtime.
-   Building a debugging tool that needs to access all symbols in the program and its dependencies.

Non-use cases for `-rdynamic`:

-   Building a small command-line utility that does not need to load any shared libraries or expose any symbols to other programs.
-   Building a security-critical program where exposing all symbols in the dynamic symbol table could make it easier for an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities.
-   Building a program with name conflicts between its symbols and those of a shared library, as this could lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.

In general, it is a good idea to avoid using `-rdynamic` unless it is necessary for the program's functionality. When in doubt, it is a good practice to carefully consider the tradeoffs between the benefits and potential risks and choose the option that best fits the program's requirements.

#### example of how `-rdynamic` can be used to make symbols from the main program available for symbol resolution by shared libraries that are loaded at runtime
Suppose we have a program `main.c` that defines a function called `foo()` and a shared library `libtest.so` that references `foo()`:

```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void foo() {
    printf("Hello from foo!\n");
}

// libtest.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

void call_foo() {
    void (*foo_ptr)() = dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "foo");
    if (foo_ptr != NULL) {
        printf("Calling foo from libtest...\n");
        foo_ptr();
    } else {
        printf("Error: symbol foo not found.\n");
    }
}
```
When `libtest.so` is compiled and linked without the `-rdynamic` flag, it cannot resolve symbols from the main program's dynamic symbol table. So if we compile and link `libtest.so` without `-rdynamic` and try to call `foo()` from `libtest.so`, we get an error:
```c
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o libtest.so libtest.c -ldl
$ ./prog
Error: symbol foo not found.
```
However, if we compile and link `main.c` with the `-rdynamic` flag, it makes symbols from the program's symbol table available for symbol resolution to shared libraries that are loaded later with `dlopen()`. So if we compile and link `main.c` with `-rdynamic` and call `call_foo()` from `libtest.so`, it can successfully resolve and call `foo()` from `main.c`:
```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>

void foo() {
    printf("Hello from foo!\n");
}

// libtest.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

void call_foo() {
    void (*foo_ptr)() = dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "foo");
    if (foo_ptr != NULL) {
        printf("Calling foo from libtest...\n");
        foo_ptr();
    } else {
        printf("Error: symbol foo not found.\n");
    }
}

// prog.c
#include <dlfcn.h>

int main() {
    void *handle = dlopen("./libtest.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    if (handle != NULL) {
        printf("Loaded libtest with handle %p.\n", handle);
        void (*call_foo_ptr)() = dlsym(handle, "call_foo");
        if (call_foo_ptr != NULL) {
            printf("Calling call_foo from libtest...\n");
            call_foo_ptr();
        } else {
            printf("Error: symbol call_foo not found.\n");
        }
        dlclose(handle);
    } else {
        printf("Error: failed to load libtest.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
$ gcc -rdynamic -o prog main.c prog.c -ldl
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o libtest.so libtest.c -ldl
$ ./prog
Loaded libtest with handle 0x7fcfe9c5f050.

In this example, the program `main.c` is compiled with the `-rdynamic` flag, which makes its symbols, including `foo()`, available for symbol resolution to shared libraries that are loaded later with `dlopen()`. When we call `call_foo()` from

q: what's the difference between -rdyanmic and rtld_global??
a; 
`-rdynamic` and `RTLD_GLOBAL` are two different concepts related to dynamic linking in Linux systems.

`-rdynamic` is a linker option that tells the linker to include all symbols in the program in the dynamic symbol table, which is used for symbol resolution at runtime. This means that symbols from the program can be resolved by shared libraries that are loaded at runtime using `dlopen()`. This can be useful when a program needs to reference symbols from shared libraries, or when a shared library needs to reference symbols from the main program.

`RTLD_GLOBAL` is a flag that can be passed to the `dlopen()` function when loading a shared library at runtime. When a shared library is loaded with `RTLD_GLOBAL`, its symbols become available for symbol resolution to all other shared libraries that are loaded, including those that were loaded before it. This can be useful when a shared library needs to reference symbols that are defined in other shared libraries.

In other words, the difference between `-rdynamic` and `RTLD_GLOBAL` is that `-rdynamic` affects the program's symbol table and makes symbols from the program available to shared libraries, while `RTLD_GLOBAL` affects the shared library's symbol table and makes symbols from the shared library available to other shared libraries.

It is worth noting that while both `-rdynamic` and `RTLD_GLOBAL` are related to dynamic linking, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. `-rdynamic` is a linker option used at build time, while `RTLD_GLOBAL` is a flag used at runtime when loading a shared library.
