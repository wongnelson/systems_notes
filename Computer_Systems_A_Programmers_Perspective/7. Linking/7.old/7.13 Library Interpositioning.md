### Q: What is library interpositioning?

A: Library interpositioning is a technique that allows you to intercept calls to shared library functions and execute your own code instead. This technique can be used for various purposes, such as tracing the number of times a particular library function is called, validating and tracing its input and output values, or even replacing it with a completely different implementation.

### Q: How does library interpositioning work?

A: First, you create a wrapper function with the same prototype as the target function you want to interpose. Then, using an interpositioning mechanism, you trick the system into calling the wrapper function instead of the target function. The wrapper function executes its own logic, then calls the target function and passes its return value back to the caller.

### Q: When can interpositioning occur?

A: Interpositioning can occur at different stages of the compilation process: at compile time, link time, or run time as the program is being loaded and executed. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most appropriate method for their specific use case.

### Q: Why is library interpositioning important and practical?

A: With library interpositioning, developers have the power to modify the behavior of existing functions without having to modify the original source code. This can be especially useful when dealing with legacy code or third-party libraries that are no longer actively maintained. Library interpositioning can help you add new features, fix bugs, or optimize performance of existing code. However, interposing on library functions should be used with caution, as it can introduce subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities if not implemented properly.

## Compile-time interpositioning 
Compile-time interpositioning is a technique used to interpose a shared library function at compile time, which means that the interposed function will be used only for the specific compilation unit where it is defined.

Here's an example of how compile-time interpositioning works:

Suppose you have a program that uses the `rand()` function from the standard C library to generate a random number. However, you want to replace the `rand()` function with your own implementation that generates better random numbers. To do this, you can create a new function with the same name as `rand()` and compile it with the program.

Here's the code for the replacement `rand()` function:
```c
int rand(void) {
    // Add your custom logic here to generate better random numbers
    // ...
    return 42; // Just an example, should be a real random number
}
```
In this example, we have created a new function with the same name and prototype as the original `rand()` function. When the program is compiled, the compiler will resolve the call to `rand()` to the replacement function instead of the original function.

To compile the program with the replacement `rand()` function, you need to include the source file containing the replacement function in the compilation command. Here's an example of how to do it:
```c
$ gcc myprogram.c myrand.c -o myprogram
```
In this example, `myprogram.c` contains the code for the program that calls the `rand()` function, and `myrand.c` contains the code for the replacement `rand()` function. The `gcc` command compiles both source files and links them together to create the `myprogram` executable.

Now, every time the program calls the `rand()` function, it will actually be calling the replacement function that you have defined. This allows you to replace the behavior of the `rand()` function without modifying the original source code.

Compile-time interpositioning can be a useful tool for modifying the behavior of shared library functions on a per-compilation-unit basis. However, it can be limited in scope and may not be suitable for more complex use cases. Additionally, it can introduce compatibility issues if the replacement function is not binary-compatible with the original function. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only when appropriate.

## Link time interpositioning
Link time interpositioning is a technique used to interpose a shared library function at link time, which means that the interposed function will be used instead of the original function every time the program is executed.

Here's an example of how link time interpositioning works:

Suppose you have a program that calls the `printf()` function from the standard C library to print a string to the console. However, you want to add some additional behavior to the `printf()` function, such as logging the output to a file or encrypting the output before it is printed. To do this, you can create a wrapper function that intercepts calls to `printf()` and adds the desired behavior.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int printf(const char *format, ...) {
    // Add your custom logic here
    // ...
    
    // Call the original printf() function with the same arguments
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, format);
    int ret = vprintf(format, args);
    va_end(args);
    
    return ret;
}
```
In this example, we have created a new function with the same name and prototype as the original `printf()` function. When the program is linked, the linker will resolve the call to `printf()` to the wrapper function instead of the original function. The wrapper function adds custom logic before and after calling the original `printf()` function to achieve the desired behavior.

To link the program with the interposed `printf()` function, you need to compile and link the wrapper function with the program using the `-Wl,-wrap,printf` option. This option tells the linker to interpose the `printf()` function with the wrapper function at link time. Here's an example of how to do it:
```c
$ gcc -c myprintf.c
$ gcc -Wl,-wrap,printf myprogram.c myprintf.o -o myprogram
```
In this example, `myprintf.c` contains the code for the wrapper function, and `myprogram.c` contains the code for the program that calls the `printf()` function. The `-Wl,-wrap,printf` option tells the linker to interpose the `printf()` function with the wrapper function.

Now, every time the program calls the `printf()` function, it will actually be calling the wrapper function, which in turn calls the original `printf()` function with the same arguments. This allows you to add custom behavior to the `printf()` function without modifying the original source code.

Link time interpositioning can be a powerful tool for modifying the behavior of shared library functions. However, it can also introduce subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities if not implemented properly, so it should be used with caution.

## Run time
Run-time interpositioning is a technique used to interpose a shared library function at run time, which means that the interposed function will be used only for the specific instance of the program that is running.

Here's an example of how run-time interpositioning works:

Suppose you have a program that calls the `open()` function from the standard C library to open a file. However, you want to intercept the `open()` function and log the file accesses for debugging purposes. To do this, you can create a shared library with a replacement `open()` function that logs the file accesses, and then use the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to load the shared library at run time.

Here's the code for the replacement `open()` function in the shared library:
```c
// Define the new "open" function with the same signature as the original
int open(const char *pathname, int flags, ...) {
    // Add your custom logic here to log the file access
    // ...

    // Call the original "open" function with the same arguments
    mode_t mode = 0;
    if (flags & O_CREAT) {
        // If the O_CREAT flag is set, the "mode" argument is also provided
        va_list args;
        va_start(args, flags);
        mode = va_arg(args, mode_t);
        va_end(args);
    }
    
    // Get a pointer to the original "open" function using the "dlsym" function
    // This function takes two arguments: a handle to the dynamic library to search, and the name of the symbol to look up
    // We use the "RTLD_NEXT" handle to search for the next occurrence of the "open" symbol after this function
    int (*original_open)(const char *, int, mode_t) = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "open");
    
    // Call the original "open" function with the same arguments, and return its result to the caller
    return original_open(pathname, flags, mode);
}

```
In this example, we have created a new function with the same name and prototype as the original `open()` function in the shared library. When the program is run, the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is set to the path of the shared library, which causes the replacement `open()` function to be loaded and interposed over the original `open()` function.

To run the program with the interposed `open()` function, you need to set <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the `LD_PRELOAD` </mark>environment variable to the path of the shared library. Here's an example of how to do it:
```c
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o myopen.so myopen.c -ldl
$ LD_PRELOAD=./myopen.so ./myprogram
```

In this example, `myopen.c` contains the code for the replacement `open()` function in the shared library, and `myprogram` is the program that calls the `open()` function. The `gcc` command compiles the `myopen.c` source file into a shared library named `myopen.so` with the `-shared` and `-fPIC` options, and links it with the `libdl` library using the `-ldl` option. The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is set to the path of the shared library, and the `myprogram` is run with the interposed `open()` function.

Now, every time the program calls the `open()` function, it will actually be calling the replacement function that you have defined in the shared library. This allows you to intercept and modify the behavior of the `open()` function without modifying the original source code.

Run-time interpositioning can be a powerful tool for modifying the behavior of shared library functions without modifying the original source code. However, it can also introduce subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities if not implemented properly, so it should be used with caution.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">`LD_PRELOAD` is</mark> an environment variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that allows you to load a shared library before any other shared libraries that the program may depend on.

When a program starts up, the dynamic linker searches for shared libraries that are needed by the program, and loads them into memory. The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable allows you to override this process by specifying a path to a shared library that should be loaded first, before any other libraries.

This can be used for various purposes, including:

-   Interposing shared library functions with custom implementations, as we saw in the example of run-time interpositioning. By setting `LD_PRELOAD` to the path of the shared library that contains the replacement functions, you can ensure that they are loaded and used instead of the original functions.
    
-   Debugging or profiling programs by overriding specific shared library functions with custom implementations that log or trace program behavior.
    
-   Applying patches or workarounds to programs by providing modified shared libraries that fix known issues or add new features.
    

Note that using `LD_PRELOAD` can have unintended consequences and should be used with caution. It can cause conflicts or incompatibilities with other libraries or system components, and can introduce security vulnerabilities if not used properly.
