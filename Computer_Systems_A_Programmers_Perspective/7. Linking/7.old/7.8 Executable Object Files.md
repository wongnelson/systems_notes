The format of an executable object file is similar to that of a relocatable object file

q; what is the program's entry point?
a; the address of the first instruction to execute when the program runs

q; "The `.text, .rodata`, and `.data` sections are similar to those in a relocatable object file, except that these sections have been relocated to their eventual run-time memory addresses". what does "The `.text, .rodata`, and `.data` sections are similar to those in a relocatable object file, except that these sections have been relocated to their eventual run-time memory addresses" mean?
a; When a program is compiled, the addresses of its code and data sections are typically not yet known, as they will depend on where in memory the program is loaded at runtime.

In a relocatable object file, the addresses of the code and data sections are expressed in terms of their offsets from the beginning of the file. These offsets will need to be adjusted based on where the program is loaded in memory when it is run.

In an executable object file, however, the linker has already determined the memory addresses to which the code and data sections will be loaded at runtime. As a result, the executable object file contains the code and data sections with their final memory addresses already determined, rather than just offsets.

This means that the executable object file can be loaded into memory and executed without needing to adjust the addresses of its code and data sections, since they have already been relocated to their final run-time memory addresses.

- Since the executable is _fully linked_ (relocated), it needs no `.rel` sections
- ELF executables are designed to be easy to load into memory, with contiguous chunks of the executable file mapped to contiguous memory segments. This mapping is described by the _program header table_

```c

	Read-only code segment
1	LOAD off	0x0000000000000000 vaddr 0x0000000000400000 paddr 0x0000000000400000 align 2**21

	Read/write data segment
3	LOAD off	 0x0000000000000df8 vaddr 0x0000000000600df8 paddr 0x0000000000600df8 align 2**21
4	   filesz 0x0000000000000228 memsz 0x0000000000000230 flags rw-
```
`off`: offset in object file; `vaddr/paddr`: memory address; `align`: alignment requirement; `filesz`: segment size in object file; `memsz`: segment size in memory; `flags`: run-time permissions.

Line 1 and 2:
the first segment (the _code segment_) has read/execute permissions, starts at memory address `0x400000`, has a total size in memory of `0x69c` bytes, and is initialized with the first `0x69c` bytes of the executable object file, which includes the ELF header, the program header table, and the `.init, .text`, and `.rodata` sections.

Lines 3 and 4 tell us that the second segment (the data segment) has read/write permissions, starts at memory address 0x600df8, has a total memory size of 0x230 bytes, and is initialized with the 0x228 bytes in the .data section starting at offset 0xdf8 in the object file

 q; what's the vaddr field?
 a; it specifies where a segment should be loaded into memory

q; when loading a segment from an executable into memory - the OS wants to map it to a specific page. what does the OS need to do to make it efficient?
a; it requires that the starting address of the segment in memory is aligned to the same boundary as the offset of the segment in the object file, modulo the page size. This alignment is specified by the `align` field in the program header.

For example, in the data segment of the program header table, the `vaddr` field is 0x600df8, and the `off` field is 0xdf8. The `align` field is 2^21 or 0x200000, which is the page size. To ensure efficient loading, the starting address of the segment in memory must satisfy the following condition:

`vaddr mod align = off mod align`

In this case, `0x600df8 mod 0x200000 = 0xdf8`, and `0xdf8 mod 0x200000 = 0xdf8`, so the alignment condition is met. This means that the segment can be loaded efficiently into memory without having to perform any additional byte shifting or copying. This is important for performance reasons, particularly for large files where the alignment requirement can significantly impact the time it takes to load the file into memory.
