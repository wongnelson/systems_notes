## Why are object file called object files?
Object files are called "object files" because they contain object code, which is machine code generated by a compiler or an assembler from the source code. The object code is not yet executable, but it is in a format that can be linked with other object files and libraries to create an executable program. The object file contains information about the program's symbols (e.g., functions, variables, etc.) and their addresses in memory, as well as information about the code and data sections of the program. Once the object files are linked, the resulting executable file can be loaded into memory and executed by the computer's processor.

## How does object code look like?
Object code is machine code that is generated by a compiler or an assembler from source code. It is in binary format and is composed of instructions that can be executed by a computer processor. The specific format of object code varies depending on the machine architecture, operating system, and programming language used.

For example, here is a snippet of x86-64 object code in hexadecimal format:
```c
55 48 89 e5 48 83 ec 10 48 89 7d f8 c7 45 f4 00
00 00 00 c7 45 f0 00 00 00 00 eb 0e 8b 45 f0 8d
50 ff 89 c7 e8 00 00 00 00 89 c2 c9 c3
```
This object code corresponds to a function written in assembly language that saves the base pointer, allocates space on the stack, and performs various operations on memory locations. It ends with a return instruction (`c9 c3`), which transfers control back to the calling function.

## What are the three forms of object files?

Object files come in three forms:

1.  **Relocatable object file**: Contains binary code and data in a form that can be combined with other relocatable object files at compile time to create an executable object file.
2.  **Executable object file**: Contains binary code and data in a form that can be copied directly into memory and executed.
3.  **Shared object file**: A special type of relocatable object file that can be loaded into memory and linked dynamically, at either load time or run time.

## What do compilers and assemblers generate? What do linkers generate?

Compilers and assemblers generate relocatable object files, including shared object files. On the other hand, linkers generate executable object files.

## What is the difference between an object module and an object file?

Technically, an object module is a sequence of bytes, while an object file is an object module stored on disk in a file. However, these terms are often used interchangeably in practice.

## What are some common object file formats used in different systems?

Object files are organized according to specific object file formats, which vary from system to system. Some common object file formats include:

-   **a.out format**: Used by the first Unix systems from Bell Labs. Executables are still referred to as a.out files to this day.
-   **Portable Executable (PE) format**: Used by Windows.
-   **Mach-O format**: Used by Mac OS-X.
-   **Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)**: Used by modern x86-64 Linux and Unix systems.

## What is the structure of a typical ELF relocatable object file?

A typical ELF relocatable object file has a specific structure, which includes different sections to store code, data, and metadata. While the exact structure may vary depending on the system, the basic concepts of organizing code and data sections are similar across different object file formats.
