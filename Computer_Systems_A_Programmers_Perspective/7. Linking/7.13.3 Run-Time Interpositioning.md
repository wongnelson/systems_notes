## What is Run-Time Interpositioning in Linux?

Run-time interpositioning is a mechanism that allows you to replace function calls at run-time, requiring only access to the executable object file. This technique is enabled by the dynamic linker's `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable in Linux.

When `LD_PRELOAD` is set to a list of shared library pathnames (separated by spaces or colons), the dynamic linker (`ld-linux.so`) searches the `LD_PRELOAD` libraries first, before any other shared libraries, to resolve undefined references. This allows you to interpose on any function in any shared library, including `libc.so`, when loading and executing any executable.

Here's an example of wrapper functions for `malloc` and `free` used in run-time interpositioning:

```c
#ifdef RUNTIME
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

/* malloc wrapper function */
void *malloc(size_t size)
{
    void *(*mallocp)(size_t size);
    char *error;

    mallocp = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "malloc"); /* Get address of libc malloc */
    if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL) {
        fputs(error, stderr);
        exit(1);
    }
    char *ptr = mallocp(size); /* Call libc malloc */
    printf("malloc(%d) = %p\n", (int)size, ptr);
    return ptr;
}

/* free wrapper function */
void free(void *ptr)
{
    void (*freep)(void *) = NULL;
    char *error;

    if (!ptr)
        return;

    freep = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "free"); /* Get address of libc free */
    if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL) {
        fputs(error, stderr);
        exit(1);
    }
    freep(ptr); /* Call libc free */
    printf("free(%p)\n", ptr);
}
#endif
```

## How Do You Compile and Run a Program with Run-Time Interpositioning?

Firstly, you need to compile the source file into a shared library that contains the wrapper functions. Then, compile the main program. Here are the necessary commands:

```bash
linux> gcc -DRUNTIME -shared -fpic -o mymalloc.so mymalloc.c -ldl
linux> gcc -o intr int.c
```

To run the program with run-time interpositioning, you need to set the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to the path of your shared library before executing the program. Here's how to do it:

For bash shell:

```bash
linux> LD_PRELOAD="./mymalloc.so" ./intr
```

For csh or tcsh shells:

```bash
linux> (setenv LD_PRELOAD "./mymalloc.so"; ./intr; unsetenv LD_PRELOAD)
```

The output of the program will be something like:

```bash
malloc(32) = 0x1bf7010
free(0x1bf7010)
```

## Can LD_PRELOAD Be Used to Interpose on Any Executable Program?

Yes, `LD_PRELOAD` can be used to interpose on the library calls of any executable program. For instance, you can interpose on the `/usr/bin/uptime` program:

```bash
linux> LD_PRELOAD="./mymalloc.so" /usr/bin/uptime
```

Doing this will print the trace of `malloc` and `free` calls made by the `uptime` program, similar to:

```bash
malloc(568) = 0x21bb010
free(0x21bb010)
malloc(15) = 
```

## When would you want to use compile time interpositioning

1. **Instrumentation and profiling**: Run-time interpositioning allows you to insert code that collects data or performs measurements during the execution of functions. This can be helpful for profiling performance, analyzing code behavior, or gathering runtime statistics.

2. **Debugging and error checking**: By intercepting function calls at run time, you can add additional error checking or debugging logic to track and handle specific conditions or errors. This can be useful for diagnosing issues, logging information, or providing detailed error messages.

3. **Dynamic behavior modification**: Run-time interpositioning enables you to modify the behavior of specific functions dynamically. You can replace or augment the original functionality with custom logic, allowing you to adapt or extend the behavior of a program without modifying its source code. This can be valuable for implementing feature toggles, applying patches or fixes, or adding new functionality to existing programs.

4. **Testing and simulation**: Run-time interpositioning can facilitate the creation of mock objects or simulated environments by intercepting calls to external functions or libraries. This allows for controlled testing of different scenarios, isolating components, or simulating certain behaviors for testing purposes.

5. **Dynamic library customization**: With run-time interpositioning, you can modify the behavior of shared libraries dynamically, allowing you to customize their functionality or override specific functions according to your needs. This can be particularly useful when you want to extend or modify the functionality of existing libraries without modifying their source code.

It's important to note that run-time interpositioning should be used judiciously and with caution, as it introduces dynamic modifications that can have unintended consequences if not implemented properly. Careful consideration should be given to factors such as performance impact, compatibility, and maintainability when applying run-time interpositioning techniques.

## When to use compile vs link vs run time interpositioning
The choice of using compile time, link time, or run time interpositioning depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. Here's a breakdown of when each approach might be suitable:

Compile Time Interpositioning:
- Use compile time interpositioning when you have control over the source code and want to modify the behavior of specific functions or libraries at compile time. This approach allows you to directly modify and recompile the source code to incorporate the desired changes.

Link Time Interpositioning:
- Use link time interpositioning when you have access to the object files or libraries during the linking phase but don't want to modify the original source code. Link time interpositioning involves modifying the linking process to intercept and redirect function calls to custom implementations. This approach provides flexibility without requiring modifications to the original source code.

Run Time Interpositioning:
- Use run time interpositioning when you need dynamic and flexible modifications to the behavior of functions or libraries during program execution. Run time interpositioning allows you to intercept function calls at runtime and replace them with custom implementations. This approach is particularly useful when you want to modify behavior without recompiling or relinking the program, making it suitable for scenarios such as instrumentation, profiling, debugging, dynamic behavior modification, testing, and dynamic library customization.

It's important to consider the trade-offs and implications of each approach. Compile time interpositioning provides the most control but requires access to the source code and recompilation. Link time interpositioning offers intermediate flexibility by modifying the linking process. Run time interpositioning provides the highest level of flexibility but may introduce additional complexity and overhead during runtime.

The specific requirements of your application, the level of control you have over the code and build process, and the desired flexibility and performance impact will help guide your decision on which interpositioning approach to use.
