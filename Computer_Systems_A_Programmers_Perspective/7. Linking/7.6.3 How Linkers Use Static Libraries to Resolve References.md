## How Do Linkers Use Static Libraries to Resolve References?

During the symbol resolution phase, the linker scans the relocatable object files and archives in the order they appear on the compiler driver's command line. It maintains a set of relocatable object files (set E) to be merged to form the executable, a set of unresolved symbols (set U), and a set of symbols defined in previous input files (set D).

Initially, all these sets (E, U, and D) are empty.

```c
  Compiler Command Line
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | f1  | f2  | f3  | ... |
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |     |     |
   v     v     v
Linker Scanning Process

  Set E (Object Files)
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+
  |     |     |     |     |
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+

  Set U (Unresolved Symbols)
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+
  |     |     |     |     |
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+

  Set D (Defined Symbols)
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+
  |     |     |     |     |
  +-----+-----+-----+-----+

```

As the linker scans the files `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, etc., from the compiler command line, it adds the object files to set E, updates set U with unresolved symbols, and set D with defined symbols. The sets E, U, and D are initially empty and get filled as the linker process advances.

### What are the Steps Taken by the Linker When It Encounters an Object File?

When the linker encounters an object file, it adds it to the set E, and updates sets U and D to reflect the symbol definitions and references in the object file.

```c
// hypothetical object file (foo.o)

int bar();  // external reference, added to U
int baz = 0;  // symbol definition, added to D

int foo() {
    return bar() + baz;
}
```

In this hypothetical object file `foo.o`, the function `bar()` is an external reference and would be added to set U. The variable `baz` is a symbol definition and would be added to set D. The object file `foo.o` itself would be added to set E.

### What are the Steps Taken by the Linker When It Encounters a Static Library?

If the linker encounters a static library, it attempts to match the unresolved symbols in set U against the symbols defined by the members of the static library. If a member of the library defines a symbol that resolves a reference in set U, that member is added to set E, and sets U and D are updated to reflect the symbol definitions and references in that member.

This process continues until sets U and D no longer change. At this point, any member object files not included in set E are discarded, and the linker proceeds to the next input file.

### What Happens If Set U is Non-Empty After All Input Files Have Been Processed?

If set U is non-empty when the linker finishes scanning the input files on the command line, it prints an error and terminates. If set U is empty, it merges and relocates the object files in set E to build the output executable file.

## How Does the Order of Libraries and Object Files on the Command Line Affect Linking?

The order of libraries and object files on the command line is significant. If a library that defines a symbol appears on the command line before an object file that references that symbol, the reference will not be resolved and linking will fail.

For example, consider the following command:

```
linux> gcc -static ./libvector.a main2.c
```

This would result in an error because `libvector.a` is processed before `main2.c`. When `libvector.a` is processed, set U is empty, so no member object files from `libvector.a` are added to set E. Thus, the reference to `addvec` in `main2.c` is never resolved, and the linker emits an error message and terminates.

## What is the General Rule for Placing Libraries on the Command Line?

The general rule for libraries is to place them at the end of the command line. If the members of different libraries are independent, meaning no member references a symbol defined by another member, then the libraries can be placed at the end of the command line in any order.

However, if the libraries are not independent, then they must be ordered such that for each symbol `s` referenced externally by a member of a library, at least one definition of `s` follows a reference to `s` on the command line. Libraries can also be repeated on the command line if necessary to satisfy these dependencies
