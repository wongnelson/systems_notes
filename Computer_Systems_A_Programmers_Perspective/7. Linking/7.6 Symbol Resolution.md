## Symbol resolution basics

### What is symbol resolution?

Symbol resolution is a process performed by the linker to associate each symbol reference in a program with a corresponding symbol definition.

Let's illustrate a simplified representation of the symbol resolution process with two object files (modules) and a linker. 

The ASCII art below shows two modules, `Module1.o` and `Module2.o`, each with their own symbol tables. The linker, upon receiving these modules, will associate each symbol reference with its definition across these modules.

```c
Module1.o                    Module2.o
+--------------+             +--------------+
| Symbol Table |             | Symbol Table |
|              |             |              |
| foo (ref)    |             | foo (def)    |
| bar (def)    |             | baz (ref)    |
| baz (def)    |             |              |
+--------------+             +--------------+
        ^                            ^
        |                            |
        +-----------+  +-------------+
                    |  |
                  Linker
                    |  |
                    v  v
             +---------------------+
             | Final Executable    |
             | Symbol Table        |
             |                     |
             | foo (from Module2.o)|
             | bar (from Module1.o)|
             | baz (from Module1.o)|
             +---------------------+
```

In the above diagram:

- In `Module1.o`, `foo` is a reference (ref), `bar` is a definition (def), and `baz` is a definition.
- In `Module2.o`, `foo` is a definition, and `baz` is a reference.
- The linker takes these modules as input, and resolves the symbols:
  - `foo` is defined in `Module2.o`, so the reference in `Module1.o` is linked to this definition.
  - `bar` is defined in `Module1.o`, and is not referenced elsewhere, so it remains as is.
  - `baz` is defined in `Module1.o`, so the reference in `Module2.o` is linked to this definition.
- The final executable's symbol table contains all the resolved symbols.

This is a simplified view of the process, and actual symbol resolution involves more complex elements like handling of local and global scope, symbol visibility, and dealing with weak and strong symbols.

### What is the purpose of symbol resolution?

The purpose of symbol resolution is to resolve dependencies between symbol references and symbol definitions in a program. It ensures that every symbol used in the program has a defined location in memory.

### When does symbol resolution occur?

Symbol resolution takes place during the linking phase of the compilation process. After the compilation of individual source files, the linker combines them to create an executable or a shared library. During this process, symbol resolution is performed.

## How does the linker resolve local symbols?

### Q: What are local symbols in the context of linking?

Local symbols are symbols that are defined and referenced exclusively within the same module. They are not visible or accessible from other modules or files.

### Q: How does the linker handle resolution of local symbols?

The linker finds the definitions and references of local symbols within the same module. Since local symbols are limited to the module's scope, the resolution process is relatively straightforward.

### Q: What mechanism does the compiler employ to ensure the uniqueness of local symbols within a module?

Yes, the compiler ensures that there is only one definition of each local symbol per module, ensuring uniqueness.

### Q: What is the advantage of resolving local symbols during the linking process?

Since local symbols are confined to a single module, the linker can easily associate each symbol reference within the module with its corresponding definition. The resolution process for local symbols is simpler and more efficient compared to resolving symbols that span multiple modules.

### Q: Are static local variables treated as local symbols during linking?

Yes, static local variables are considered local symbols during the linking process. The compiler ensures that their names are unique within the module, and they get associated with local linker symbols. This allows the linker to resolve and manage these variables within the module.

## How does the linker handle unresolved global symbols?

When the compiler encounters a symbol that isn't defined in the current module, it assumes that the symbol is defined in another module. It then generates a linker symbol table entry for this symbol and leaves the task of resolving this symbol to the linker.

If the linker can't find a definition for the referenced symbol in any of its input modules, it fails and terminates with an error message.

```c
void foo(void); // This is a declaration of a global symbol.

int main() {
    foo(); // If the linker can't find the definition of foo, it will fail.
    return 0;
}
```

## How does the linker resolve global symbols defined in multiple modules?

Symbol resolution for global symbols can be complex because these symbols might be defined in multiple object modules. When this happens, the linker must either flag an error or choose one of the definitions and discard the rest. 

This process involves cooperation between the compiler, assembler, and linker. If not handled correctly, it can lead to confusing bugs. For example:

```c
// Module 1
int x = 10; // Global symbol x defined here.

// Module 2
int x = 20; // Global symbol x defined here too. This could lead to a conflict.
```

In such cases, the linker's behavior and the rules it follows depend on the specific linker and the flags passed to it during the linking process.
