## What is an Executable Object File?

An executable object file is the final output of the linker, which merges multiple object files into a single file. This file is binary and contains all the necessary information to load the program into memory and execute it.

## What Information Does an Executable Object File Contain?

[[7.4 Relocatable Object Files]]
An executable object file, specifically in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), contains information such as:

- The ELF header, which describes the overall format of the file, including the program's entry point (the address of the first instruction to execute when the program runs).
- The `.text`, `.rodata`, and `.data` sections, similar to those in a relocatable object file, but these sections have been relocated to their eventual run-time memory addresses.
- The `.init` section defines a small function, called `_init`, that will be called by the program's initialization code.
- Since the executable is fully linked (relocated), it doesn't need `.rel` sections.
  
## What is a Program Header Table?

A program header table is part of the executable object file that describes how contiguous chunks of the executable file map to contiguous memory segments. This design makes ELF executables easy to load into memory.

Here's an example:

```plaintext
	Read-only code segment
1	LOAD off	0x0000000000000000 vaddr 0x0000000000400000 paddr 0x0000000000400000 align 2**21
2	   filesz 0x000000000000069c memsz 0x000000000000069c flags r-x
	Read/write data segment
3	LOAD off	 0x0000000000000df8 vaddr 0x0000000000600df8 paddr 0x0000000000600df8 align 2**21
4	   filesz 0x0000000000000228 memsz 0x0000000000000230 flags rw-
```

## How to Understand the Program Header Table?

The program header table consists of multiple entries. Each entry describes a segment in memory.

For example, the first two lines describe the first segment (the code segment). It has read/execute permissions, starts at memory address `0x400000`, has a total size in memory of `0x69c` bytes, and is initialized with the first `0x69c` bytes of the executable object file, which includes the ELF header, the program header table, and the `.init`, `.text`, and `.rodata` sections.

The next two lines describe the second segment (the data segment). It has read/write permissions, starts at memory address `0x600df8`, has a total memory size of `0x230` bytes, and is initialized with the `0x228` bytes in the `.data` section starting at offset `0xdf8` in the object file. The remaining 8 bytes in the segment correspond to `.bss` data that will be initialized to zero at run time.

## What is the Significance of Alignment in the Program Header Table?

The alignment specified in the program header is an optimization that enables segments in the object file to be transferred efficiently to memory when the program executes. This efficiency is due to the way that virtual memory is organized as large contiguous power-of-2 chunks of bytes. The starting address `vaddr` of any segment `s` must satisfy the equation `vaddr mod align = off mod align`, where `off` is the offset of the segment's first section in the object file, and `align` is the alignment specified in the program header.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept:

Let's consider an object file with a program header specifying a segment `s` with an alignment of 4096 bytes (align = 4096). The offset of the segment's first section in the object file is 1024 bytes (off = 1024).

To satisfy the alignment requirement, the starting address (`vaddr`) of segment `s` must satisfy the equation `vaddr mod align = off mod align`.

In this case, the equation becomes `vaddr mod 4096 = 1024 mod 4096`.

To find a valid value for `vaddr`, we can substitute different values for `vaddr` and see if the equation holds true. Let's try a few examples:

Example 1: `vaddr = 4096`
- `4096 mod 4096 = 1024 mod 4096`  (4096 divided by 4096 yields a remainder of 0, and 1024 divided by 4096 also yields a remainder of 1024)
- The equation holds true, so `vaddr = 4096` satisfies the alignment requirement.

Example 2: `vaddr = 8192`
- `8192 mod 4096 = 1024 mod 4096`  (8192 divided by 4096 yields a remainder of 0, and 1024 divided by 4096 also yields a remainder of 1024)
- The equation holds true, so `vaddr = 8192` satisfies the alignment requirement.

Example 3: `vaddr = 3072`
- `3072 mod 4096 = 1024 mod 4096`  (3072 divided by 4096 yields a remainder of 3072, and 1024 divided by 4096 yields a remainder of 1024)
- The equation holds true, so `vaddr = 3072` satisfies the alignment requirement.

By finding a value for `vaddr` that satisfies the equation, we ensure that the segment's first section is correctly aligned in memory, which can improve memory access efficiency during program execution.

## What Does the Alignment Requirement Look Like for the Data Segment in the Given Example?

In the provided example, the data segment's alignment is represented as follows:

- The starting address `vaddr` mod `align` = `0x600df8` mod `0x200000` = `0xdf8`
- The offset `off` mod `align` = `0xdf8` mod `0x200000`= `0xdf8`

This confirms that the alignment requirement is met. This requirement helps to optimize the transfer of segments in the object file to memory when the program executes.


## What are the Main Differences Between a Relocatable Object File and an Executable Object File?

While both types of files are used in the process of creating a runnable program, there are some key differences:

- **Relocatable Object File**: This is the output of the compiler. It contains binary code, but this code isn't ready to run yet because the addresses aren't final. These files need to be linked together to form an executable.

- **Executable Object File**: This is the output of the linker. It takes one or more relocatable object files, assigns final addresses to all the symbols (variables, functions, etc.), and resolves all references to these symbols. The output is a binary file that can be loaded into memory and executed by the system.

In terms of their structure, relocatable object files contain sections like `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, and `.rel` (for relocation information), while executable object files contain similar sections, but the addresses are final and there's no need for a `.rel` section. Additionally, executable object files include an ELF header with the entry point of the program and a program header table that describes how the file segments map to memory segments.
