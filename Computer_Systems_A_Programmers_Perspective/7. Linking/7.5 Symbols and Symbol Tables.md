## What is a Symbol Table in a Relocatable Object Module?

A symbol table is contained in each relocatable object module. It provides information about the symbols that are defined and referenced within the module.

Symbols in this context can be thought of as the names of entities like variables or functions in a program. They provide essential information to the linker during the linking process.

```c
+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Symbol Table   |                                         |
|                |                                         |
| +------------+ |  +-----------+--------+--------+        |
| | Entry 1   | |  | Name      | Value  | Size   | ...    |
| |           | |  | (offset)  | (addr) | (bytes)|        |
| +------------+ |  +-----------+--------+--------+        |
| | Entry 2   | |  | Name      | Value  | Size   | ...    |
| |           | |  | (offset)  | (addr) | (bytes)|        |
| +------------+ |  +-----------+--------+--------+        |
| |    ...    | |  |    ...    |  ...   |  ...   |        |
| +------------+ |  +-----------+--------+--------+        |
| | Entry n   | |  | Name      | Value  | Size   | ...    |
| |           | |  | (offset)  | (addr) | (bytes)|        |
| +------------+ |  +-----------+--------+--------+        |
+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

An ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) symbol table is contained in the `.symtab` section of an object file. It consists of an array of entries, where each entry provides the following information about a symbol:

-   `Name`: The name of the symbol. It's a byte offset into the string table that points to the null-terminated string name of the symbol.
-   `Value`: The symbol's address. For relocatable modules, the value is an offset from the beginning of the section where the object is defined. For executable object files, the value is an absolute runtime address.
-   `Size`: The size (in bytes) of the object.
-   `Type`: The type of the symbol, usually either data or function.
-   `Binding`: Indicates whether the symbol is local or global.
-   `Section`: Each symbol is assigned to some section of the object file, denoted by this field, which is an index into the section header table.

There are also three special pseudosections - `ABS`, `UNDEF`, and `COMMON` - that do not have entries in the section header table.

## In what scenario would I need to manipulate the symbol table manually?

Manipulating the symbol table manually is a very low-level task that is usually not required in normal development. It is typically handled by the compiler and linker, which generate and manipulate the symbol table automatically.

However, in certain scenarios, an OS developer may need to interact with the symbol table directly. For example, when developing a custom bootloader, it may be necessary to manually load and relocate an executable file, which involves updating the symbol table to reflect the new memory layout.

In such scenarios, the developer would need to use specialized tools and libraries to manipulate the symbol table. For example, the ELF format provides a standardized way to represent the symbol table, and there are libraries available in many programming languages that provide an interface for working with ELF files.

In general, interacting with the symbol table directly is a low-level task that requires a deep understanding of the underlying system and is typically only required in very specific scenarios.

## What are the Three Different Kinds of Symbols in the Context of a Linker?

There are three different types of symbols in a relocatable object module:

1.  **Global symbols defined by the module:** These are symbols that are defined within the current module and can be referenced by other modules. They correspond to non-static C functions and global variables.
    
2.  **Global symbols referenced by the module but defined elsewhere:** These symbols are defined in other modules but are referenced within the current module. These are also known as externals and correspond to non-static C functions and global variables defined in other modules.
    
3.  **Local symbols:** These symbols are defined and referenced exclusively within the module. They correspond to static C functions and global variables defined with the static attribute. These symbols are only visible within the module and cannot be referenced by other modules.
    

## What is the Difference Between Local Linker Symbols and Local Program Variables?

Local linker symbols are not the same as local program variables. Local program variables are managed at runtime on the stack and do not interest the linker. On the other hand, local procedure variables defined with the C static attribute are not managed on the stack. Instead, space is allocated for them in the .data or .bss section and a local linker symbol with a unique name is created in the symbol table. This  is to prevent naming conflicts.

For instance, consider the following code snippet:
```c
int f()
{
    static int x = 0;
    return x;
}

int g()
{
    static int x = 1;
    return x;
}
```
In this example, the compiler would export a pair of local linker symbols with different names to the assembler - possibly `x.1` for the `x` in function `f` and `x.2` for the `x` in function `g`.

## What is the Difference Between COMMON and .bss?

The distinction between `COMMON` and `.bss` sections is subtle and based on the way the linker performs symbol resolution.

-   `COMMON`: This pseudosection is for uninitialized global variables.
-   `.bss`: This section is for uninitialized static variables and global or static variables that are initialized to zero.

## What Information Can be Derived from the readelf Program?

The GNU `readelf` program is a tool that helps in viewing the contents of object files. It can provide crucial information about symbol tables, among other things.

Consider the example of the `main.o` file from a C program. Using `readelf`, we can view the symbol table entries for this object file. Here is an example of the output:
```c
Num:  Value              Size    Type     Bind     Vis    Ndx    Name
8:    0000000000000000   24      FUNC     GLOBAL   DEFAULT 1      main
9:    0000000000000000   8       OBJECT   GLOBAL   DEFAULT 3      array
10:   0000000000000000   0       NOTYPE   GLOBAL   DEFAULT UND    sum
```

In this example, we see an entry for the definition of global symbol `main`, a 24-byte function located at an offset (i.e., value) of zero in the `.text` section. This is followed by the definition of the global symbol `array`, an 8-byte object located at an offset of zero in the `.data` section. The last entry comes from the reference to the external symbol `sum`. `readelf` identifies each section by an integer index. `Ndx=1` denotes the `.text` section, and `Ndx=3` denotes the `.data` section.

## What are the Types and Binding Fields in an ELF Symbol Table Entry?

In an ELF symbol table entry, the `Type` and `Binding` fields are both 4 bits each.

The `Type` field specifies the type of the symbol. Common types include data or function, but there can also be entries for individual sections and for the pathname of the original source file.

The `Binding` field indicates the visibility or linkage of the symbol. It specifies whether the symbol is local to a particular file (LOCAL) or visible across all files (GLOBAL).

## What are the Pseudosections in an Object File?

In an object file, there are three special pseudosections that don't have entries in the section header table:

-   `ABS` is for symbols that should not be relocated.
-   `UNDEF` is for undefined symbolsâ€”that is, symbols that are referenced in this object module but defined elsewhere.
-   `COMMON` is for uninitialized data objects that are not yet allocated. For `COMMON` symbols, the `value` field gives the alignment requirement, and `size` gives the minimum size.

Note that these pseudosections exist only in relocatable object files; they do not exist in executable object files.
