## How does relocating Absolute References work?

Relocating Absolute References involves modifying absolute memory references in the code. These references are typically to global data or functions that are defined in the same or other object files.

#### What is an example of an absolute reference in assembly code?

For instance, the `mov` instruction in line 4 of Figure 7.11 copies the address of `array` (a 32-bit immediate value) into register `%edi`. This `mov` instruction starts at section offset `0x9` and includes the 1-byte opcode `0xbf`, followed by a placeholder for the 32-bit absolute reference to `array`.

#### What does the corresponding relocation entry for this absolute reference look like?

The corresponding relocation entry `r` for this absolute reference consists of four fields:

- `r.offset = 0xa`
- `r.symbol = array`
- `r.type = R_X86_64_32`
- `r.addend = 0`

These fields instruct the linker to modify the absolute reference starting at offset `0xa` so that it points to the first byte of `array` at runtime.

#### What information does the linker determine for relocating this absolute reference?

Suppose that the linker has determined the runtime address for the `array` as follows:

- `ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(array) = 0x601018`

#### How does the linker update the absolute reference?

The linker updates the reference using the algorithm in Figure 7.10, as follows:

```
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend)
        = (unsigned) (0x601018 + 0)
        = (unsigned) (0x601018)
```

#### What does the relocated form of the `mov` instruction look like in the resulting executable object file?

In the resulting executable object file, the `mov` instruction has the following relocated form:

```
4004d9: bf 18 10 60 00    mov    $0x601018, %edi    %edi = &array
```

#### How does the loader handle the relocated .text and .data sections in the final executable object file?

At load time, the loader can copy the bytes from the relocated .text and .data sections directly into memory and execute the instructions without any further modifications, as shown in Figure 7.12. These sections contain the executable instructions and global data, respectively, for the program. The original C code is in Figure 7.1.
