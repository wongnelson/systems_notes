## What is the Global Offset Table (GOT) in the context of Position-Independent Code (PIC)?

The Global Offset Table (GOT) is a data structure used in generating Position-Independent Code (PIC) references to global variables. The GOT contains an 8-byte entry for each global data object (procedure or global variable) referenced by the object module. 

The significance of the GOT lies in its ability to maintain the same relative distance between the code and data segments of an object module, regardless of where the module is loaded in memory.

## How does the Global Offset Table (GOT) work?

The compiler creates the GOT at the beginning of the data segment. It then generates a relocation record for each entry in the GOT. At load time, the dynamic linker relocates each GOT entry so that it contains the absolute address of the object. 

Each object module that references global objects has its own GOT. The address of a global variable is loaded indirectly via the GOT and then utilized in memory. This technique ensures that the offset in the PC-relative reference to the GOT is a runtime constant, enabling the code to run regardless of its actual memory location.

## What if a global variable is defined by another shared module?

If a global variable, say `addcnt`, is defined by another shared module, then indirect access through the GOT would be necessary. The compiler generally opts to use the most general solution - the GOT - for all references, whether the global variable is defined in the same shared module or not.

The following ASCII art depicts a simplified representation of how GOT works:

```
        code segment               data segment
  ---------------------    -------------------------
  | instruction         |  | GOT                    |
  | movzbl addcnt, %eax |  |  [0] -> obj1           |
  | ...                 |  |  [1] -> obj2           |
  ---------------------   |  [2] -> ...             |
                          |  [3] -> addcnt (address)|
                          --------------------------
```

Here, the `movzbl` instruction in the code segment accesses the address of `addcnt` indirectly through the GOT entry at index 3 in the data segment. This allows the code to remain position-independent while still accessing the global variable `addcnt`.
