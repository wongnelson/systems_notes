## How do compiler drivers work in the compilation process?

Compiler drivers are responsible for coordinating the different stages of compilation, which include preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking. These drivers invoke the necessary tools to translate the source code into an executable object file.

For example, consider the following C program compilation command:

```sh
linux> gcc -Og -o prog main.c sum.c
```

This command uses the GNU compiler driver (gcc) to compile and link the `main.c` and `sum.c` source files into an executable named `prog`. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. Run the C preprocessor (cpp) to translate the C source file `main.c` into an intermediate file `main.i`:

   ```
   cpp [other arguments] main.c /tmp/main.i
   ```

2. Run the C compiler (cc1) to translate `main.i` into an assembly-language file `main.s`:

   ```
   cc1 /tmp/main.i -0g [other arguments] -o /tmp/main.s
   ```

3. Run the assembler (as) to translate `main.s` into a binary relocatable object file `main.o`:

   ```
   as [other arguments] -o /tmp/main.o /tmp/main.s
   ```

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the `sum.c` source file to generate `sum.o`.

5. Run the linker program (ld) to combine `main.o` and `sum.o`, along with the necessary system object files, to create the binary executable object file `prog`:

   ```
   ld -o prog [system object files and args] /tmp/main.o /tmp/sum.o
   ```

6. Execute the program by running `./prog` in the shell. The operating system's loader function copies the code and data in the executable file `prog` into memory and transfers control to the beginning of the program.

## What is the role of the linker in the compilation process?

The linker is responsible for combining relocatable object files (such as `main.o` and `sum.o`) to form an executable object file. It resolves symbol references, such as function calls and global variables, by matching them to their corresponding definitions. The linker also incorporates the necessary system object files, which provide standard library functions and system calls.

## How is the loader involved in running a program?

The loader is a function in the operating system responsible for loading an executable program into memory and starting its execution. When you run a program (e.g., `./prog`), the loader copies the code and data in the executable file into memory and transfers control to the beginning of the program. This allows the program to run with access to its required resources, such as memory and external libraries.
