## Lazy Binding Intro

### What is Lazy Binding?

Lazy Binding is a technique used in compilation systems to defer the binding of procedure addresses until the first time the procedure is called. It is specifically used when a program calls a function defined by a shared library, where the compiler doesn't know the runtime address of the function in advance.

Here's a simplified ASCII representation of the lazy binding process.

Firstly, we have our main program, a shared library, and the dynamic linker:

```
Main Program      Shared Library     Dynamic Linker
------------      --------------     --------------
| Function A |   | Function B |     |    Bind    |
------------      --------------     --------------
```

When the program is run and Function A calls Function B, which is in the shared library, the dynamic linker hasn't resolved the address of Function B yet. 

```
Main Program      Shared Library     Dynamic Linker
------------      --------------     --------------
| Function A |-->| Function B |     |    Bind    |
------------      --------------     --------------
    CALL B
```

Since Function B's address is not resolved yet, it triggers the dynamic linker's bind operation:

```
Main Program      Shared Library     Dynamic Linker
------------      --------------     --------------
| Function A |   | Function B | <-- |    Bind    |
------------      --------------     --------------
               BIND B
```

The bind operation finds the actual address of Function B. The address is then saved, and Function B is called:

```
Main Program      Shared Library     Dynamic Linker
------------      --------------     --------------
| Function A |-->| Function B |     |    Bind    |
------------      --------------     --------------
    CALL B
```

For subsequent calls to Function B, the saved address is used directly without invoking the bind operation. This is the essence of "lazy" binding -- the operation is deferred until the first time it is actually needed.

### What are the benefits of Lazy Binding?

Lazy Binding offers several benefits, including:

1.  Improved loading time: By deferring the binding of function addresses until they are actually needed, the initial loading time of the program can be reduced.
    
2.  Reduced memory footprint: Unnecessary relocations and symbol resolutions are avoided, resulting in a more efficient memory usage.
    
3.  Efficient utilization of shared libraries: Lazy Binding is motivated by the fact that most application programs only call a small fraction of the functions exported by a shared librar. Lazy Binding ensures that only the necessary functions from a shared library are loaded and resolved, optimizing resource utilization.

### Is Lazy Binding specific to GNU compilation systems?

Lazy Binding is commonly used in GNU compilation systems, but it is not limited to them. Other compilers and operating systems may also employ similar techniques to achieve deferred binding and improve the performance of programs using shared libraries.

## How is Lazy Binding Implemented?

Lazy Binding is implemented using an interaction between two data structures: the Global Offset Table (GOT) and the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT). If an object module calls any functions that are defined in shared libraries, then it has its own GOT and PLT. The GOT is part of the data segment, while the PLT is part of the code segment.

## What is the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT)?

The PLT is an array of 16-byte code entries (essentially pointers). Each shared library function called by the executable has its own PLT entry. Each of these entries is responsible for invoking a specific function. For example, in a scenario where `addvec` and `printf` are the functions called by the user code, `PLT[2]` invokes `addvec` and `PLT[3]` invokes `printf`.

## How does the GOT and PLT work together?

The GOT and PLT work together to lazily resolve the run-time address of a function. When used in conjunction with the PLT, the GOT contains information that the dynamic linker uses when it resolves function addresses. Each of the remaining entries corresponds to a called function whose address needs to be resolved at run time. Each has a matching PLT entry. For example, `GOT[4]` and `PLT[2]` correspond to `addvec`. Initially, each GOT entry points to the second instruction in the corresponding PLT entry.

Here's a simplified ASCII representation of the interaction between the Global Offset Table (GOT) and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) in the context of lazy binding:

```c
Procedure Linkage Table (PLT)
------------------------------
| PLT[0] |   Special entry that jumps into the dynamic linker
| PLT[1] |   Invokes system startup function (__libc_start_main)
| PLT[2] |-->Invokes addvec (user code function)
| PLT[3] |   Invokes printf (user code function)
------------------------------

Global Offset Table (GOT)
------------------------------
| GOT[0] |   Information for dynamic linker
| GOT[1] |   Information for dynamic linker
| GOT[2] |-->Entry point for dynamic linker in ld-linux.so module
| GOT[3] |   ...
| GOT[4] |-->Corresponds to addvec, initially points to second instruction in PLT[2]
------------------------------
```

Here are the steps involved in Lazy Binding using GOT and PLT?

The following steps illustrate how the GOT and PLT work together to lazily resolve the run-time address of a function (e.g. `addvec`) the first time it is called:

1. Instead of directly calling `addvec`, the program calls into `PLT[2]`, which is the PLT entry for `addvec`.

2. The first PLT instruction does an indirect jump through `GOT[4]`. Since each GOT entry initially points to the second instruction in its corresponding PLT entry, the indirect jump simply transfers control back to the next instruction in `PLT[2]`.

3. After pushing an ID for `addvec` (0x1) onto the stack, `PLT[2]` jumps to `PLT[0]`.

4. `PLT[0]` pushes an argument for the dynamic linker indirectly through `GOT[1]` and then jumps into the dynamic linker indirectly through `GOT[2]`. The dynamic linker uses the two stack entries to determine the runtime location of `addvec`, overwrites `GOT[4]` with this address, and passes control to `addvec`.

For any subsequent invocations of `addvec`:

1. Control passes to `PLT[2]` as before.

2. However, this time the indirect jump through `GOT[4]` transfers control directly to `addvec`.
