## What happens when an assembler generates an object module?

### What is the purpose of relocation entries in an object module?

Relocation entries in an object module provide instructions to the linker on how to modify references to objects whose locations are unknown at the time of assembly. They allow the linker to adjust the references when merging the object files into an executable.

Executable
```
Here, the object module consists of code that references unknown locations. Each of these references has a corresponding relocation entry. When the linker merges the object modules into an executable, it uses the instructions in the relocation entries to adjust the references to their correct locations. The resulting executable has code where all references are correctly adjusted.

### How are relocation entries generated?

Relocation entries are generated by the assembler when it encounters references to objects with unknown locations. The assembler creates these entries to instruct the linker on how to modify the references during the linking process.

### What information do relocation entries contain?

Relocation entries specify the type of relocation and the location within the object module that requires modification. They provide information on how to adjust the references to code or data objects during the linking process (as a struct).

### Where are relocation entries for code and data placed?

Relocation entries for code objects are placed in the `.rel.text` section, while relocation entries for data objects are placed in the `.rel.data` section. These sections contain the necessary information for the linker to perform the required relocations.

### Why are relocation entries necessary?

Relocation entries are necessary because, at the time of assembly, the assembler does not have information about the final memory locations of the code and data. Additionally, it may not have knowledge of externally defined functions or global variables. Relocation entries allow the linker to resolve these unknown references and adjust them appropriately during the linking process.

## What is the format of an ELF relocation entry?

The ELF relocation entry consists of four main elements:

1. **Offset**: This is the section offset of the reference that will need to be modified.
2. **Symbol**: This identifies the symbol that the modified reference should point to.
3. **Type**: This informs the linker on how to modify the new reference.
4. **Addend**: This is a signed constant that some types of relocations use to bias the value of the modified reference.

Here is a code example to illustrate the structure of an ELF relocation entry:

```c
typedef struct {
	long offset;		/* Offset of the reference to relocate */
	long type:32,		/* Relocation type */
		symbol:32;	/* Symbol table index */
	long addend;		/* Constant part of relocation expression */
} Elf64_Rela;
```

## What are the basic relocation types defined by ELF?

ELF defines 32 different relocation types, but the two most basic and relevant types are:

1. **R_X86_64_PC32**: This type relocates a reference that uses a 32-bit PC-relative address. A PC-relative address is an offset from the current run-time value of the program counter (PC). When the CPU executes an instruction using PC-relative addressing, it forms the effective address (e.g., the target of the call instruction) by adding the 32-bit value encoded in the instruction to the current run-time value of the PC, which is always the address of the next instruction in memory.

2. **R_X86_64_32**: This type relocates a reference that uses a 32-bit absolute address. With absolute addressing, the CPU directly uses the 32-bit value encoded in the instruction as the effective address, without further modifications.

These two relocation types support the x86-64 small code model, which assumes that the total size of the code and data in the executable object file is smaller than 2 GB, and thus can be accessed at run-time using 32-bit PC-relative addresses. The small code model is the default for gcc.

## What about programs larger than 2 GB?

Programs larger than 2 GB can be compiled using the `-mcmodel=medium` (medium code model) and `-mcmodel=large` (large code model) flags. However, these models are not covered in this content.
