## What is Link-Time Interpositioning in Linux?

Link-time interpositioning is a technique supported by the Linux static linker, which allows you to replace calls to a target function with calls to a wrapper function at the time of linking. The linker uses the `--wrap f` flag, where `f` is the name of the function you want to interpose. This flag resolves references to the symbol `f` as `__wrap_f` and references to the symbol `__real_f` as `f`.

Consider the following code example:

**Example program (`int.c`):**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

int main()
{
    int *p = malloc(32);
    free(p);
    return(0);
}
```
**Local `malloc.h` file:**
```c
#define malloc(size) mymalloc(size)
#define free(ptr) myfree(ptr)

void *mymalloc(size_t size);
void myfree(void *ptr);
```
**Wrapper functions in `mymalloc.c`:**
```c
#ifdef LINKTIME
#include <stdio.h>

void *__real_malloc(size_t size);
void __real_free(void *ptr);

/* malloc wrapper function */
void *__wrap_malloc(size_t size)
{
    void *ptr = __real_malloc(size); /* Call libc malloc */
    printf("malloc(%d) = %p\n", (int)size, ptr);
    return ptr;
}

/* free wrapper function */
void __wrap_free(void *ptr)
{
    __real_free(ptr); /* Call libc free */
    printf("free(%p)\n", ptr);
}
#endif
```

## How Do You Compile and Link a Program with Link-Time Interpositioning?

The following commands can be used to compile and link the program with link-time interpositioning:

```bash
linux> gcc -DLINKTIME -c mymalloc.c
linux> gcc -c int.c
linux> gcc -Wl,--wrap,malloc -Wl,--wrap,free -o intl int.o mymalloc.o
```

The `-DLINKTIME` argument in the first command defines the `LINKTIME` macro, which ensures that the wrapper functions are compiled. The `-Wl,--wrap,malloc` and `-Wl,--wrap,free` arguments in the third command tell the linker to replace references to `malloc` and `free` with references to `__wrap_malloc` and `__wrap_free`, respectively.

## What Happens When You Run a Program with Link-Time Interpositioning?

When you run a program with link-time interpositioning, each call to the target functions will be replaced with a call to the corresponding wrapper function. 

For example, running the `intl` program in the example above would produce the following output:

```bash
linux> ./intl
malloc(32) = 0x18cf010
free(0x18cf010)
```

This output is produced by the `__wrap_malloc` and `__wrap_free` wrapper functions, which print a trace before calling the real `__real_malloc` and `__real_free` functions.

## When would you want to use compile time interpositioning

Here are some scenarios where link time interpositioning can be useful:

1. **Third-party library modification**: If you are using a third-party library and want to modify or extend its behavior without directly modifying the library source code, link time interpositioning can be a viable option. You can create wrapper functions that intercept the library calls and add custom logic or behavior.

2. **Dependency resolution**: Link time interpositioning can help resolve conflicts between multiple versions of the same library. If your program depends on different versions of a library or if there are conflicting symbols, you can use interpositioning to redirect the calls to the desired version.

3. **Behavior modification and customization**: Link time interpositioning allows you to customize the behavior of library functions in the final executable. You can intercept specific function calls and replace them with alternative implementations or modify their behavior to meet your application's requirements.

4. **Testing and debugging**: Link time interpositioning can be used for testing and debugging purposes. You can intercept library calls and replace them with mock implementations or additional instrumentation to gather runtime information or simulate certain scenarios.

It's important to note that link time interpositioning requires access to the object files or the intermediate code during the linking phase. This approach offers more flexibility than compile time interpositioning as it allows you to modify the behavior of existing libraries without modifying their source code directly. However, it does require additional steps in the build process and may involve more complex setup compared to compile time interpositioning.
