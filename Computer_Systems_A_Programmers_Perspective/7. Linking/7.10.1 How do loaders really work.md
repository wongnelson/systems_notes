## What is the Conceptual Process of Loading an Executable File?

The conceptual process of loading involves copying the code and data from an executable object file from disk into memory. Once the program is in memory, the loader starts execution by jumping to the program's first instruction, which is also known as the entry point. 

However, this description of loading, while conceptually correct, is not entirely accurate. The complete process of how loading really works involves understanding the concepts of processes, virtual memory, and memory mapping. 

## How Does Loading Really Work in the Context of Processes, Virtual Memory, and Memory Mapping?

Here's a more detailed overview of how loading works in a Linux system:

1. **Process Context:** Each program in a Linux system runs in the context of a process with its own virtual address space.

2. **Forking a Child Process:** When the shell runs a program, the parent shell process "forks" a child process that is a duplicate of the parent.

3. **Invoking the Loader:** The child process invokes the loader via the `execve` system call.

4. **Creating New Memory Segments:** The loader deletes the child's existing virtual memory segments and creates a new set of code, data, heap, and stack segments. The new stack and heap segments are initialized to zero.

5. **Initializing New Code and Data Segments:** The new code and data segments are initialized to the contents of the executable file by mapping pages in the virtual address space to page-size chunks of the executable file.

6. **Starting Execution:** Finally, the loader jumps to the `_start` address, which eventually calls the application's main routine. 

It's important to note that aside from some header information, there is no copying of data from disk to memory during loading. The copying is deferred until the CPU references a mapped virtual page, at which point the operating system automatically transfers the page from disk to memory using its paging mechanism.
