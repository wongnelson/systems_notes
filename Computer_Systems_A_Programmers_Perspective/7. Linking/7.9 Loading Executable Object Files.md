## What is the Role of a Loader in Running an Executable Object File?

The loader is a component of the operating system that allows a program to be run. When an executable object file, such as `prog`, is invoked from the command line:

```bash
linux> ./prog
```

The shell, recognizing that `prog` is not a built-in command, assumes it is an executable object file. The loader is then invoked. The loader's role is to copy the code and data from the executable object file from disk into memory. Once the program is in memory, the loader starts execution by jumping to the program's first instruction, which is also known as the entry point. This process of copying the program into memory and then running it is referred to as loading.
```

## What Does the Runtime Memory Image of a Running Linux Program Look Like?

Here's an ASCII art representation of the different memory segments in a Linux x86-64 system. Remember that this is a simplified representation and actual memory layouts can be more complex due to factors such as address-space layout randomization (ASLR) and segment alignment requirements.

```ascii
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF +-----------------+
                   |                 |
                   |  Kernel Space   |
                   |                 |
0x00007FFFFFFFF000 +-----------------+ <---- Largest legal user address (2^48 - 1)
                   |                 |
                   |   User Stack    |
                   |        |        |
                   |        V        |
                   |                 |
                   | Shared Modules  |
                   |                 |
                   |       Heap      |
                   |        ^        |
                   |        |        |
                   |                 |
                   |   Data Segment  |
                   |                 |
0x0000000000400000 +-----------------+ <---- Code Segment start address
                   |                 |
                   |  Code Segment   |
                   |                 |
0x0000000000000000 +-----------------+ <---- Lowest memory address
```

1. **Code Segment**: This starts at `0x400000` and contains the executable code of the program.

2. **Data Segment**: This follows the code segment and contains the initialized and uninitialized data of the program.

3. **Heap**: The heap follows the data segment and grows upwards, as depicted by the arrow. This is where dynamically allocated memory is located, managed by calls to the `malloc` library function.

4. **Shared Modules Region**: This region is reserved for shared modules.

5. **User Stack**: The user stack starts below the largest legal user address (`2^48 - 1`) and grows downwards, as shown by the arrow. This is where function call information and local variables are stored.

6. **Kernel Space**: The region above the stack, starting at address `2^48`, is reserved for the code and data in the kernel. This is the memory-resident part of the operating system.

## How Does the Loader Create a Runtime Memory Image?

When the loader runs, it creates a memory image of the program. It does this by following the program header table in the executable object file and copying chunks of the file into the code and data segments in memory.

Once the copying is done, the loader jumps to the program's entry point. For all C programs, this entry point is the `_start` function, which is defined in the system object file `crt1.o`.

The `_start` function then calls the system startup function, `__libc_start_main`, which is defined in `libc.so`. This function initializes the execution environment, calls the user-level `main` function, handles the return value from `main`, and if necessary, returns control to the kernel. This process ensures that the program is properly set up and ready to run.
