# What is a Static Library?

A static library is a single file that packages related object modules together. The linker, when creating an output executable file, only copies the object modules from the library that are referenced by the application program. 

In the context of C programming, standard I/O, string manipulation, and integer math functions such as `atoi`, `printf`, `scanf`, `strcpy`, and `rand` are available in the `libc.a` library, and floating-point math functions such as `sin`, `cos`, and `sqrt` are in the `libm.a` library.

## Why Do Systems Support the Notion of Libraries?

Programming systems support libraries as a way to provide standardized functions to developers without adding unnecessary complexity or size to their programs. Consider the following scenarios:

- If the compiler had to recognize calls to standard functions and generate the appropriate code directly, it would significantly complicate the compiler and need constant updates whenever a function was added, deleted, or modified.
- Alternatively, putting all standard C functions in a single relocatable object module (like `libc.o`) would lead to wastage of disk space and memory, as every executable file would contain a complete copy of all standard functions. This approach would also complicate the development and maintenance of standard functions.
- A third approach of creating a separate relocatable file for each standard function and storing them in a well-known directory would be time-consuming and error-prone for developers.

Using static libraries resolves these issues. Related functions can be compiled into separate object modules and packaged in a single static library file.

## What is an Example of Using Static Libraries?

Let's consider an example where we have two vector routines: `addvec` and `multvec`. Each routine is defined in its own object module and performs a vector operation on a pair of input vectors and stores the result in an output vector. Each routine also records the number of times it has been called by incrementing a global variable.

The code for `addvec` looks like this:

```c
1	int addcnt = 0; 2
3	void addvec(int *x, int *y,
4				int *z, int n)
5	{
6		int i;
7
8		addcnt++;
9
10		for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
11			z[i] = x[i] + y[i];
12	}
```

The code for `multvec` is similar:

```c
1	int multcnt = 0;
2
3	void multvec(int *x, int *y,
4			int *z, int n)
5	{
6		int i;
7
8		multcnt++;
9
10		for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
11			z[i] = x[i] * y[i];
12	}
```

To create a static library of these functions, we would use the `ar` tool:

```bash
linux> gcc -c addvec.c multvec.c
linux> ar rcs libvector.a addvec.o multvec.o
```
The `ar rcs` command is a Unix/Linux command used to create or modify an archive file, typically known as a static library. Here's what each option does:

- `ar`: This specifies the `ar` command, which stands for "archive."
- `r`: This option tells `ar` to add files to the archive or replace existing files with the same name.
- `c`: This option creates the archive file if it doesn't already exist. If the file already exists, it is updated.
- `s`: This option updates the symbol table of the archive file. It ensures that the symbols from the object files included in the archive are added to or updated in the symbol table.

So, in the command `ar rcs libvector.a addvec.o multvec.o`, the `ar rcs` part is used to create or modify the archive file `libvector.a` by adding the object files `addvec.o` and `multvec.o` to it. It also updates the symbol table of the archive file to include the symbols from the object files.

Now, to use this library in an application, such as `main2.c` which uses the `addvec` routine, we need to include the function prototypes for the routines in `libvector.a`, compile and link the input files `main2.o` and `libvector.a`:

```bash
linux> gcc -c main2.c
linux> gcc -static -o prog2c main2.o . /libvector.a
```

The `main2.c` program:

```c
1	#include <stdio.h>
2	#include "vector.h"
3
4	int x[2] = {1, 2}
5	int y[2] = {3, 4};
6	int z[2];
7
8	int main()
9	{
10		addvec(x, y, z, 2);
11		printf("z = [%d %d] n", z[0], z[1]);
12		return 0;
13	}
```

In this example, the `-static` argument tells the compiler driver that the linker should build a fully linked executable object file that can be loaded into memory and run without any further linking at load time. The `-L.` argument tells the linker to look for `libvector.a` in the current directory.

## What Happens During Linking with Static Libraries?

During linking, the linker determines that the `addvec` symbol defined by `addvec.o` is referenced by `main2.o`, so it copies `addvec.o` into the executable. Since the program doesn't reference any symbols defined by `multvec.o`, the linker does not copy this module into the executable. The linker also copies the `printf.o` module from `libc.a`, along with a number of other modules from the C run-time system.

This process reduces the size of the executable on disk and in memory, while also simplifying the application developer's task of including only a few library files.

An ASCII representation of linking with static libraries could look like this:
```c
      +-----------+        +------------------+
      |  main2.o  |------->| addvec.o         |
      |           |        +------------------+
      +-----------+        | multvec.o (not copied) |
                            +------------------+
      +-----------+        +------------------+
      | libc.a    |------->| printf.o         |
      +-----------+        +------------------+
                            | Other modules   |
                            +------------------+
```
