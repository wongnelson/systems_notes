## How does relocating PC-Relative References work?

Relocating PC-Relative References involves modifying the reference to a function or variable in such a way that the final reference points to the correct location at runtime. This is particularly important in cases where the function or variable is defined in a different object file or module. Let's consider an example where function `main` calls the `sum` function, which is defined in module `sum.o`.

#### What does the call instruction to a function look like?

In the assembly code, the call instruction to the `sum` function starts at section offset `0xe` and consists of the 1-byte opcode `0xe8`, followed by a placeholder for the 32-bit PC-relative reference to the target `sum`.

Here is an ASCII representation of the assembly code with the call instruction to the `sum` function:

```ascii
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Section Offset | Assembly Code  |    Opcode      |   Description  |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
|     ....       |      ....      |      ....      |      ....      |
|     0xE        | call sum       |      0xE8      | call instruction to `sum` |
|     ....       |      ....      |      ....      |      ....      |
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
```
In this table:

- "Section Offset" indicates the memory offset within the section where the instruction is located.
- "Assembly Code" is the assembly language representation of the instruction.
- "Opcode" is the numeric code corresponding to the assembly instruction (in this case, `0xE8` represents the `call` instruction).
- "Description" provides a brief explanation of the instruction.

Please note that "...." is used to denote other instructions in the code.

The `call` instruction at offset `0xE` uses the opcode `0xE8` and is followed by a placeholder. This placeholder will be replaced by the linker with a PC-relative reference to the target function (`sum`), allowing the program to call the `sum` function regardless of where it is loaded into memory.

#### How is a relocation entry for a PC-relative reference represented?

The corresponding relocation entry `r` for this PC-relative reference consists of four fields:

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">- `r.offset = 0xf`</mark>
- `r.symbol = sum`
- `r.type = R_X86_64_PC32`
<span style="background:#d3f8b6">- `r.addend = -4`</span>

These fields instruct the linker to modify the 32-bit PC-relative reference starting at offset `0xf` so that it will point to the `sum` routine at runtime.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>
The `call` instruction in x86 assembly is a 5-byte instruction. The first byte, `0xe8`, is the opcode for `call`. The next 4 bytes are used to store the relative offset to the target function from the next instruction. In this case, the offset starts at the next byte after the `call` opcode, hence `0xf` (which is `0xe` for the `call` instruction start plus 1 byte for the opcode itself).

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">green</span>
The `addend` of `-4` is used because the PC-relative offset used by the `call` instruction is calculated from the next instruction after `call`, which is 5 bytes long in total (1 byte for the opcode and 4 bytes for the offset). The PC value when the `call` instruction is executed is the address of the next instruction, not the start of the `call` instruction. Thus, when calculating the offset, we subtract 4 to account for the 4 bytes of the `call` instruction's offset operand.

#### How does the linker determine the runtime addresses?

Suppose that the linker has determined the runtime addresses as follows:

- `ADDR(s) = ADDR(.text) = 0x4004d0`
- `ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(sum) = 0x4004e8`

Calculation below.

#### How does the linker compute the runtime address of the reference?

Using the algorithm shown in Figure 7.10, the linker first computes the run-time address of the reference (line 7):

```
refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset
        = 0x4004d0 + 0xf
        = 0x4004df
```

#### How does the linker update the reference to point to the correct routine at runtime?

The linker then updates the reference so that it will point to the `sum` routine at runtime (line 8):

```
*refptr = (unsigned) (ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr)
        = (unsigned) (0x4004e8 + (-4) - 0x4004df)
        = (unsigned) (0x5)
```

#### How does the relocated form of the call instruction look like in the resulting executable object file?

In the resulting executable object file, the call instruction has the following relocated form:

```
4004de: e8 05 00 00 00    callq 4004e8 <sum>    sum()
```

#### What happens at runtime when the CPU executes the call instruction?

At runtime, the `call` instruction will be located at address `0x4004de`. When the CPU executes the `call` instruction, the PC (Program Counter) has a value of `0x4004e3`, which is the address of the instruction immediately following the `call` instruction. To execute the `call` instruction, the CPU performs the following steps:

1. Push PC onto the stack.
2. `PC ‚Üê PC + 0x5 = 0x4004e3 + 0x5 = 0x4004e8`

Thus, the next instruction to execute is the first instruction of the `sum` routine, which is the intended outcome.
