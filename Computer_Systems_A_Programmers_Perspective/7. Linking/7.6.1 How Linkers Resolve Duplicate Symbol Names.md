## How do linkers resolve duplicate symbol names?

When dealing with a collection of relocatable object modules, a linker might encounter scenarios where multiple modules define global symbols with the same name. The Linux compilation system resolves these duplicate symbols based on the notion of strong and weak symbols. 

During compile time, the compiler exports each global symbol to the assembler as either strong or weak. Functions and initialized global variables get strong symbols, while uninitialized global variables get weak symbols. 

### What are the rules for resolving duplicate symbol names?

The Linux linker follows these rules to handle duplicate symbol names:

**Rule 1:** Multiple strong symbols with the same name are not allowed.

```c
/* foo1.c */
int main() { return 0; }

/* bar1.c */
int main() { return 0; }
```
In this case, the linker will generate an error message because the strong symbol `main` is defined multiple times.

**Rule 2:** Given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols with the same name, choose the strong symbol.

```c
/* foo3.c */
int x = 15213; // strong symbol

/* bar3.c */
int x; // weak symbol
```
In this case, the linker will quietly choose the strong symbol `x` defined in `foo3.c`.

**Rule 3:** Given multiple weak symbols with the same name, choose any of the weak symbols.

```c
/* foo4.c */
int x; // weak symbol

/* bar4.c */
int x; // weak symbol
```
In this case, the linker can choose any definition of `x` since both are weak symbols.

### What problems can arise from these rules?

The application of rules 2 and 3 can introduce subtle run-time bugs, especially if the duplicate symbol definitions have different types. For instance, if `x` is defined as an `int` in one module and a `double` in another, this could overwrite memory locations with unexpected values due to differences in data type sizes.

```c
/* foo5.c */
int y = 15212;
int x = 15213;

/* bar5.c */
double x;
```
In the above case, the assignment to `x` in `bar5.c` could overwrite the memory locations for both `x` and `y` in `foo5.c` due to the size difference between `int` and `double`.

### How to avoid these issues?

To avoid these issues, you can invoke the linker with a flag such as the gcc `-fno-common` flag, which triggers an error if it encounters multiply-defined global symbols. Another option is to use the `-Werror` option, which turns all warnings into errors.

### Why does the compiler assign symbols to COMMON and .bss?

The compiler assigns symbols to COMMON and .bss due to the possibility that the linker might encounter multiple modules defining global symbols with the same name. When the compiler encounters a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">weak global symbol,</mark> it defers the decision to the linker by assigning the symbol to COMMON. If the symbol is initialized to zero, it's a strong symbol (unique by rule 2), so the compiler assigns it to .bss. Similarly, static symbols are unique by construction, so the compiler confidently assigns them to either .data or .bss.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between weak and strong global symbols:

Let's say we have two C files, `file1.c` and `file2.c`, that define the same global variable `x`. In `file1.c`, we define `x` as a strong symbol, and in `file2.c`, we define `x` as a weak symbol (Note: Weak symbols are implicitly defined). 

file1.c:
```c
int x = 10; // Strong symbol definition
```

file2.c:
```c
int x __attribute__((weak)) = 20; // Weak symbol definition
```

During the linking process, if both `file1.o` and `file2.o` are linked together, the linker will choose the strong symbol `x` from `file1.o` over the weak symbol `x` from `file2.o`. So the final value of `x` will be 10.

However, if we remove the strong symbol definition from `file1.c` and only have the weak symbol definition in `file2.c`, the linker will use the weak symbol `x` with the value 20 as the final definition for `x`.

In summary, a strong symbol takes precedence over a weak symbol with the same name during the linking process.
