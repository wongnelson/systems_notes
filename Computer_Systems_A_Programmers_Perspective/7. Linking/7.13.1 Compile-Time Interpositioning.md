## What is Compile-Time Interpositioning in C?

Compile-time interpositioning in C involves using the C preprocessor to replace calls to a target function with calls to a wrapper function. This is achieved by defining macros in a header file that replace the target function names with the wrapper function names.

Consider the following code example:

**Example program (`int.c`):**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

int main()
{
    int *p = malloc(32);
    free(p);
    return(0);
}
```
**Local `malloc.h` file:**
```c
#define malloc(size) mymalloc(size)
#define free(ptr) myfree(ptr)

void *mymalloc(size_t size);
void myfree(void *ptr);
```
**Wrapper functions in `mymalloc.c`:**
```c
#ifdef COMPILETIME
#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

/* malloc wrapper function */
void *mymalloc(size_t size)
{
    void *ptr = malloc(size);
    printf("malloc(%d)=%p\n", (int)size, ptr);
    return ptr;
}

/* free wrapper function */
void myfree(void *ptr)
{
    free(ptr);
    printf("free(%p)\n", ptr);
}
#endif
```
In this case, the local `malloc.h` file contains `#define` directives that replace `malloc` and `free` with `mymalloc` and `myfree`, respectively. These are the names of the wrapper functions in `mymalloc.c`.

## How Do You Compile and Link a Program with Compile-Time Interpositioning?

The following commands can be used to compile and link the program with compile-time interpositioning:

```bash
linux> gcc -DCOMPILETIME -c mymalloc.c
linux> gcc -I. -o intc int.c mymalloc.o
```

The `-DCOMPILETIME` argument in the first command defines the `COMPILETIME` macro, which ensures that the wrapper functions are compiled. The `-I.` argument in the second command tells the C preprocessor to look for the `malloc.h` header file in the current directory before looking in the standard system directories. This is crucial because the local `malloc.h` file contains the macro definitions for interpositioning.

## What Happens When You Run a Program with Compile-Time Interpositioning?

When you run a program with compile-time interpositioning, each call to the target functions will be replaced with a call to the corresponding wrapper function. 

For example, running the `intc` program in the example above would produce the following output:

```bash
linux> ./intc
malloc(32)=0x9ee010
free(0x9ee010)
```

This output is produced by the `mymalloc` and `myfree` wrapper functions, which print a trace before calling the real `malloc` and `free` functions.

## When would you want to use compile time interpositioning

There are several scenarios where compile time interpositioning can be beneficial:

1. **Performance optimization**: By replacing certain library functions with optimized versions, you can improve the performance of your program. This allows you to customize the behavior of specific functions to better suit your application's requirements.

2. **Behavior modification**: Compile time interpositioning can be used to modify the behavior of library functions to meet specific needs. For example, you can intercept file I/O functions and redirect them to custom implementations or add additional checks and validations.

3. **Debugging and logging**: By interposing certain functions, you can add logging or debugging capabilities to track function calls, monitor parameters, and observe the flow of execution. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

4. **Security enhancements**: Compile time interpositioning can be used to enforce security measures such as input validation, data encryption, or access control by intercepting relevant function calls and adding the necessary security checks.

It's important to note that compile time interpositioning requires modifying the source code and recompiling the program. This approach is most effective when you have control over the source code and can integrate the necessary changes during the development process.
