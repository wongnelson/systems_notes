### What is an ELF relocatable object file?

An ELF relocatable object file is a type of object file format used in Unix-based operating systems for storing executable code, data, and other resources. It is designed to be linked with other object files to create a final executable or shared library.

### What does an ELF relocatable object file contain?

An ELF relocatable object file consists of three main parts:

-   The ELF header: It contains information such as the word size, byte ordering, object file type, machine type, and the location and size of the section header table.
-   The section header table: It includes fixed-size entries for each section in the object file. Each entry describes the attributes of the corresponding section, such as its name, type, size, virtual address, and file offset.
-   Multiple sections: Each section contains a specific type of data, such as executable code, data, relocation information, symbol tables, and debug information.

In this diagram, the ELF relocatable object file starts with the ELF Header, which contains information about the word size, byte ordering, object file type, machine type, and the location and size of the section header table. Following the header are various sections containing specific data types. Finally, the Section Header Table provides information about the attributes of each section, such as their names, types, sizes, virtual addresses, and file offsets.

### What is the purpose of the section header table?

The section header table provides a way for programs to access and manipulate the sections in an object file. Each entry in the table describes a section and its attributes, such as its name, type, size, virtual address, and file offset. The linker uses this information to connect sections from multiple object files and create a final executable or shared library.

## What are the typical sections in an ELF relocatable object file?

A typical ELF relocatable object file contains the following sections:

-   `.text`: Contains the machine code of the compiled program.
-   `.rodata`: Stores read-only data such as format strings in printf statements and jump tables for switch statements.
-   `.data`: Holds initialized global and static C variables.
-   `.bss`: Contains uninitialized global and static C variables and any global or static variables initialized to zero. It doesn't occupy actual space in the object file.
-   `.symtab`: A symbol table with information about functions and global variables defined and referenced in the program.
-   `.rel.text`: A list of locations in the .text section that will need to be modified when the linker combines this object file with others.
-   `.rel.data`: Relocation information for any global variables referenced or defined by the module.
-   `.debug`: A debugging symbol table with entries for local variables, typedefs, global variables, and the original C source file (only present if the compiler driver is invoked with the -g option).
-   `.line`: A mapping between line numbers in the original C source program and machine code instructions in the .text section (only present if the compiler driver is invoked with the -g option).
-   `.strtab`: A string table for the symbol tables in the .symtab and .debug sections and for the section names in the section headers.

## What is the purpose of the .bss section in a relocatable object file?

The .bss section in a relocatable object file contains uninitialized global and static C variables, along with any global or static variables initialized to zero. It doesn't occupy actual space in the object file, serving as a placeholder. The term ".bss" originally stood for "block started by symbol" and is used to save space in the object file, as uninitialized variables don't need to occupy disk space.

## What is the difference between the .data and .bss sections in a relocatable object file?

The .data section holds initialized global and static C variables, whereas the .bss section contains uninitialized global and static C variables and any global or static variables initialized to zero. The main difference is that the .data section occupies actual space in the object file, while the .bss section doesn't, as it serves as a placeholder for uninitialized variables.

## What is the purpose of relocation entries in relocatable object files?

Relocation entries, such as `.rel.text` and `.rel.data`, are used to provide information on locations in the object file that need to be modified when the linker combines it with other object files. They specify which instructions or global variables need to be modified to ensure correct linking of object files into a single executable.
