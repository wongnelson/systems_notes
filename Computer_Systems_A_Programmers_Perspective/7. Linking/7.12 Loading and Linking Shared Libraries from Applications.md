## What is Position-Independent Code (PIC) and why is it important?

### Q: What is Position-Independent Code (PIC)?

Position-Independent Code (PIC) refers to code that can be executed regardless of its absolute memory address. It is designed to be loaded and executed from any memory location without requiring modifications by the linker. 

### Q: Why is PIC important for shared libraries?

PIC is particularly important for shared libraries because it allows them to be shared among multiple processes. Without PIC, each process would need its own copy of the library, resulting in wasteful memory usage. PIC enables a single instance of the shared library's code segment to be loaded into memory and shared by multiple processes, thereby optimizing memory resources.

### Q: What is the role of the linker in relation to PIC?

The linker plays a role in generating position-independent code by ensuring that the code and data references within the shared library are properly resolved regardless of the library's actual memory address. It handles the necessary relocation and linking processes to make the shared library compatible with PIC requirements.

## How is Position-Independent Code generated?

In GNU compilation systems, PIC is generated using the `-fpic` option with `gcc`. This instruction tells the compiler to create code that isn't tied to a specific address. This flexibility allows the code to execute from whichever address it's loaded into. This feature is crucial for shared libraries, which must always be compiled with this option.

```bash
gcc -fpic -shared -o libexample.so example.c
```

In the above example, `libexample.so` is a shared library compiled as PIC from the `example.c` source file.

## How does Position-Independent Code work on x86-64 systems?

On x86-64 systems, references to symbols (procedures, variables, etc.) within the same executable object module require no special treatment to be PIC. They can be compiled using PC-relative (Program Counter-relative) addressing. This method calculates addresses relative to the current instruction (i.e., the program counter's value), allowing the code to run regardless of its actual memory location.

However, references to external procedures and global variables defined by shared modules require special techniques, which will be discussed next.
