## How are Shared Libraries Loaded and Linked from Applications?

Shared libraries can be loaded and linked when an application is executed, as well as while the application is running, upon the application's request. The latter is accomplished without having to link the application against those libraries at compile time.

## Can you Provide Real World Examples of Dynamic Linking?

Yes, dynamic linking is widely utilized due to its power and versatility. Here are two notable examples:

1. **Distributing Software Updates:** Developers of Microsoft Windows applications often use shared libraries to distribute software updates. They create a new version of a shared library, which users can download and use to replace the current version. The next time they run their application, it will automatically link and load the new shared library.

2. **Building High-Performance Web Servers:** Many web servers generate dynamic content, such as personalized web pages, account balances, and banner ads. Early web servers generated dynamic content by using `fork` and `execve` to create a child process and run a "CGI program" in the context of the child. However, modern high-performance web servers generate dynamic content using a more efficient approach based on dynamic linking. Each function that generates dynamic content is packaged in a shared library. When a request arrives from a web browser, the server dynamically loads and links the appropriate function and then calls it directly. This technique has a significant impact on the throughput of a busy site.

## How can an Application Load and Link Shared Libraries at Run Time?

Linux systems provide a simple interface to the dynamic linker that allows application programs to load and link shared libraries at runtime. The functions `dlopen`, `dlsym`, `dlclose`, and `dlerror` from the `<dlfcn.h>` library provide this functionality.

1. **`dlopen`:** The `dlopen` function loads and links the shared library filename. The external symbols in filename are resolved using libraries previously opened with the `RTLD_GLOBAL` flag. 

2. **`dlsym`:** The `dlsym` function takes a handle to a previously opened shared library and a symbol name and returns the address of the symbol, if it exists, or `NULL` otherwise.

3. **`dlclose`:** The `dlclose` function unloads the shared library if no other shared libraries are still using it.

4. **`dlerror`:** The `dlerror` function returns a string describing the most recent error that occurred as a result of calling `dlopen`, `dlsym`, or `dlclose`, or `NULL` if no error occurred.

## Can you Provide a Code Example of Dynamic Linking at Run Time?

Here is an example of how you might dynamically link a shared library at run time and then invoke a routine. This example uses the `libvector.so` shared library and the `addvec` routine:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

int x[2] = {1, 2};
int y[2] = {3, 4};
int z[2];

int main()
{
    void *handle;
/**
The declaration `void (*addvec)(int *, int *, int *, int)` defines a function pointer named `addvec`. The function pointer `addvec` is capable of pointing to a function that takes four arguments: three `int` pointers and one `int` value. The function itself returns `void`, which means it does not return any value.

In other words, `addvec` can be used to store the memory address of a function that matches the specified signature. Once `addvec` is assigned the address of a compatible function
**/
    void (*addvec)(int *, int *, int *, int);
    char *error;

    /* Dynamically load the shared library containing addvec() */
    handle = dlopen("./libvector.so", RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%sn", dlerror());
        exit(1);
    }

    /* Get a pointer to the addvec() function we just loaded */
    addvec = dlsym(handle, "addvec");
    if ((error = dlerror()) != NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%sn", error);
        exit(1);
    /* Now we can call addvec() just like any other function */
	    addvec(x, y, z, 2);
	    printf("z = [%d %d]\n", z[0], z[1]);
	
	    /* Unload the shared library */
	    if (dlclose(handle) < 0) {
	        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", dlerror());
	        exit(1);
	    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code dynamically loads and links the `libvector.so` shared library at run time. The `addvec` function, which resides in this shared library, is then invoked. 

The `dlopen` function is used to load the shared library. If there's an error in this process, it is caught and printed using `dlerror`. 

Next, a pointer to the `addvec` function is obtained using the `dlsym` function. Again, any error during this process is caught and printed. 

The `addvec` function is then called just like any other function. 

Finally, the shared library is unloaded using the `dlclose` function. If there's an error in unloading the library, it is caught and printed.

This method of dynamic linking allows for a high degree of flexibility and efficiency in managing shared libraries in a Linux system.
