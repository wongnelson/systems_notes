## Library Interpositioning 
### What is library interpositioning?
Library interpositioning is a technique supported by Linux linkers that allows you to intercept calls to shared library functions and execute your own code instead. It provides a way to modify the behavior of existing library functions or add custom logic without modifying the original source code.

### How does library interpositioning work?
To interpose on a target function, you create a wrapper function with the same prototype as the target function. Through interpositioning mechanisms, the system is tricked into calling the wrapper function instead of the target function. The wrapper function can then perform additional operations before or after calling the target function.

### What are the benefits of library interpositioning?
Library interpositioning offers flexibility and extensibility by allowing you to modify the behavior of existing functions. It enables you to trace function calls, validate inputs and outputs, add logging or debugging capabilities, or even replace the target function with a custom implementation.

### Can you provide an example of library interpositioning?
Suppose we have a program that calls the `malloc` and `free` functions from the C standard library. We want to trace the calls to these functions during program execution. We can achieve this using library interpositioning by creating wrapper functions `malloc` and `free` with the same prototypes as the original functions. By interposing on these functions, we can add our own logging or tracing logic inside the wrapper functions.

## How Do You Create a Wrapper Function for Interpositioning?

To interpose on a target function, you need to create a wrapper function with the same prototype as the target function. This wrapper function will be called instead of the original function.

Consider the following example where we wish to interpose on the `malloc` function in C:

```c
void *malloc(size_t size) {
    void *(*libc_malloc)(size_t) = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "malloc");
    void *ptr = libc_malloc(size);
    
    // Additional code here to trace the call, validate the size, etc.

    return ptr;
}
```

In this example, `dlsym` is a function provided by the dynamic linker that returns the address of the `malloc` symbol in the next object file in the search order after the object file containing the caller of `dlsym`. `RTLD_NEXT` is a special handle that tells `dlsym` to find the next occurrence of the desired symbol. 

This code does the following:
1. It gets the real `malloc` function from the system's libc.
2. It calls the real `malloc` and gets a pointer `ptr`.
3. It allows the addition of custom code to do things like tracing the call or validating the size.
4. Finally, it returns `ptr`.

## When Can Interpositioning Occur?

Interpositioning can occur at compile time, link time, or run time as the program is being loaded and executed.

- **Compile-time interpositioning** happens when the code is being compiled. The compiler replaces calls to the target function with calls to the wrapper function.

- **Link-time interpositioning** occurs when the code is being linked. The linker redirects references from the target function to the wrapper function.

- **Run-time interpositioning** happens when the program is being loaded and executed. The dynamic linker redirects calls from the target function to the wrapper function.

Each type of interpositioning has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the situation.
