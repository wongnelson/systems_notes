## What is two's-complement encoding?

Two's-complement encoding is a common computer representation of signed numbers, where the most significant bit of the word has a negative weight. It allows us to represent both positive and negative numbers in binary form. The most significant bit is called the sign bit, and it determines the sign of the number: 1 for negative and 0 for nonnegative.

### Why is two's-complement encoding important?

Two's-complement encoding is important because it enables computers to perform arithmetic operations on signed numbers efficiently. It also allows the use of the same hardware for both signed and unsigned numbers, simplifying the design of computer systems.

### Can you provide an example of two's-complement encoding?

Consider the 4-bit number `[1011]`. Using two's-complement encoding, we can interpret this number as follows:

`B2T4([1011]) = -1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = -8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = -5`

So, the 4-bit two's-complement representation of `-5` is `[1011]`.

## What is the range of values that can be represented with two's-complement encoding?

The range of values that can be represented by a w-bit two's-complement number is defined as follows:

-   The least representable value (TMin) is given by the bit vector `[10 ... 0]` with the integer value `-2^(w-1)`.
-   The greatest value (TMax) is given by the bit vector `[01 ... 1]` with the integer value `2^(w-1) - 1`.

For example, for a 4-bit two's-complement number:

-   TMin = -2^3 = -8
-   TMax = 2^3 - 1 = 7

## What is the principle of uniqueness of two's-complement encoding?

The principle of uniqueness of two's-complement encoding states that the function `B2Tw` is a bijection, which means that every number within the representable range has a unique encoding as a w-bit two's-complement number.

## What are the peculiar properties of two's-complement arithmetic?

Two's-complement arithmetic has some peculiar properties due to its asymmetric range. The absolute value of the minimum representable number is one greater than the absolute value of the maximum representable number. This asymmetry can lead to subtle program bugs, as there is no positive counterpart to the minimum representable number.

## How are signed integers represented in C and Java standards?

In the C language, the representation of signed integers is not strictly specified, but nearly all machines use two's-complement form. Java, on the other hand, requires a two's-complement representation with exact ranges specified for each integer data type, ensuring identical behavior across different machines and operating systems.

## Can you provide an example of two's-complement representation in code?

Consider the following C code snippet:
```c
short x = 12345;
short mx = -x;

show_bytes((byte_pointer) &x, sizeof(short));
show_bytes((byte_pointer) &mx, sizeof(short));
```
This code creates a `short` integer `x` with the value `12345` and its negation `mx`. The `show_bytes` function prints the hexadecimal representation of these values. On a big-endian machine, the output is `30 39` for `x` and `cf c7` for `mx`. In binary form, `x` is `[0011000000111001]`, and `mx` is `[110001110011101001]`. We can see that mx is the two's-complement representation of -x, which is obtained by negating all the bits in x and adding 1.

In two's-complement representation, the most significant bit (leftmost bit) is used as a sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive, and if it is 1, the number is negative. To obtain the two's-complement representation of a negative number, we first invert (flip) all the bits and then add 1 to the result.

For example, the two's-complement representation of -5 in an 8-bit system is:

Decimal representation: -5 Binary representation: 00000101 (since 5 is represented as 00000101 in binary) Invert all bits: 11111010 Add 1: 11111011

Thus, the two's-complement representation of -5 in an 8-bit system is 11111011.
