## What is unsigned encoding in binary numbers?

Unsigned encoding is a method to represent non-negative integers using a fixed number of bits. In unsigned encoding, each bit `xi` in a bit vector has a value of 0 or 1, with the value 1 indicating that `2^i` should be included as part of the numeric value. The unsigned encoding of a bit vector `x→ = [xw-1, xw-2, ..., x0]` can be expressed as a function `B2Uw` (for "binary to unsigned", length `w`):

`B2Uw(x→) = ∑(i=0 to w-1) xi * 2^i`

Unsigned encoding can represent non-negative integers in the range `[0, UMaxw]`, where `UMaxw = 2^w - 1`

### Why is unsigned encoding important and practical?

Unsigned encoding is important and practical because it provides a simple and efficient method for representing non-negative integers in computer systems. Unsigned encoding is widely used in various applications, such as memory addresses, array indices, and loop counters. It has the important property that every number between 0 and `2^w - 1` has a unique encoding as a `w`-bit value, which is essential for unambiguous representation and manipulation of numbers in a computer system.

## What is the uniqueness principle of unsigned encoding?

The uniqueness principle of unsigned encoding states that the function `B2Uw` is a bijection. In other words, `B2Uw` maps each bit vector of length `w` to a unique number between 0 and `2^w - 1`, and it has an inverse function `U2Bw` (for "unsigned to binary") that maps each number in the range `[0, 2^w - 1]` to a unique pattern of `w` bits.

This principle ensures that there is no ambiguity in the representation of non-negative integers using unsigned encoding, making it suitable for use in computer systems.

### Example of unsigned encoding for `w = 4`

Here are some examples of unsigned encoding for a 4-bit integer:

```
B2U4([0001]) = 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 1
B2U4([0101]) = 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 5
B2U4([1011]) = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 11
B2U4([1111]) = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 15
```
These examples demonstrate that each 4-bit pattern maps to a unique non-negative integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive).
