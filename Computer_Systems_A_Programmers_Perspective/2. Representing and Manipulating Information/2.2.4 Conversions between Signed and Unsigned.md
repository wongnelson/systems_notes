## What is the effect of casting between signed and unsigned data types in C?

In most C implementations, when casting between signed and unsigned data types with the same word size, the numeric values might change, but the underlying bit patterns do not. This is because the bit-level perspective is used rather than a numeric one. For example, when casting a negative signed value to an unsigned one, the numeric value changes, but the bit representation remains the same.

### Example: Casting a signed short int to an unsigned short int
```c
short int v = -12345;
unsigned short uv = (unsigned short) v;
printf("v = %d, uv = %u\n", v, uv);
```
Output on a two's-complement machine: v = -12345, uv = 53191

In this example, the bit patterns for both `-12345` and `53191` are the same, but their numeric values are different.

## How does casting from an unsigned to a signed integer work, and what is an example?

When casting from an unsigned to a signed integer, the bit representation stays the same, but the interpretation of the bits changes. For instance, the bit patterns representing the unsigned maximum value (UMax) and `-1` in two's-complement form are identical.

### Example: Casting an unsigned int to a signed int
```c
unsigned u = 4294967295u;   /* UMax */
int tu = (int) u;
printf("u = %u, tu = %d\n", u, tu);
```
Output on a two's-complement machine:  u = 4294967295, tu = -1

Here, the bit patterns for `4294967295` and `-1` are the same (32bits of all 1's), but their numeric values are different.

## What are the functions T2U and U2T, and how do they relate to casting between signed and unsigned data types in C?

The functions T2U and U2T describe the conversion between two's-complement and unsigned numbers having the same bit patterns:

1.  T2U: This function takes a number `x` between `TMin` and `TMax` and yields a number between `0` and `UMax` with an identical bit representation, except that the argument has a two's-complement representation, while the result is unsigned.
    
2.  U2T: This function takes a number `x` between `0` and `UMax` and yields a number with the same two's-complement representation as the unsigned representation of `x`.
    

These functions describe the effect of casting between signed and unsigned data types in most C implementations.

### Example: Relationship between T2U and U2T functions

Using the example of a 16-bit system:

-   `T2U16(-12,345) = 53,191`
-   `U2T16(53,191) = -12,345`

The 16-bit pattern `0xCFC7` is both the two's-complement representation of `-12,345` and the unsigned representation of `53,191`. Also, `12,345 + 53,191 = 65,536 = 2^16`.

## What is the principle for conversion from two's complement to unsigned?

The principle for conversion from two's complement to unsigned for a number `x` such that `TMinw ≤ x ≤ TMaxw` is as follows:
```c
T2Uw(x) = {x + 2^w, x < 0
           x, x ≥ 0}
```
For example, `T2U16(-12,345) = -12,345 + 2^16 = 53,191`. This principle states that negative numbers in the two's complement representation are converted to large positive numbers when converting to unsigned representation, while nonnegative numbers remain unchanged.

### Derivation of the conversion principle from two's complement to unsigned

When comparing the equations for converting from bit patterns to unsigned and two's complement representations, the weighted sums for bits from `0` to `w - 2` cancel each other, leaving a value `B2Uw(x) - B2Tw(x) = x_w-1 * 2^w`. This gives a relationship `B2Uw(x) = B2Tw(x) + x_w-1 * 2^w`.

### What is the principle for conversion from unsigned to two's complement?

The principle for conversion from unsigned to two's complement for a number `u` such that `0 ≤ u ≤ UMaxw` is as follows:
```c
U2Tw(u) = {u, u ≥ TMaxw
           u - 2^w, u > TMaxw}
```
This principle states that small numbers (≤ `TMaxw`) preserve their numeric value when converting from unsigned to two's complement, while large numbers (> `TMaxw`) are converted to negative values.

Now, let's consider another example where we want to convert the unsigned 8-bit binary number `11111111` to its two's complement representation.
```c
Unsigned number:   11111111
Decimal value:      255
TMaxw (8-bit):      127
```
Since `255` is greater than `TMaxw`, we need to use the formula `U2Tw(u) = u - 2^w`. Plugging in the values, we get:
```c
U2Tw(255) = 255 - 2^8 = 255 - 256 = -1
```
Therefore, 11111111 in unsigned binary is equivalent to -1 in 8-bit two's complement.

### How do conversions between unsigned and two's complement representations affect numeric values?

For values `x` in the range `0 ≤ x ≤ TMaxw`, both `T2Uw(x) = x` and `U2Tw(x) = x`, meaning numbers in this range have identical unsigned and two's complement representations. For values outside of this range, the conversions either add or subtract `2^w`. For example, `T2Uw(-1) = -1 + 2^w = UMaxw` maps the negative number closest to zero to the largest unsigned number.
