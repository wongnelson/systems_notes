## What are bit-level operations in C?

Bit-level operations in C are bitwise Boolean operations that can be applied to any "integral" (`int`, `short`, `long`, and `char`) data type. The symbols for Boolean operations in C are `|` for OR, `&` for AND, `~` for NOT, and `^` for XOR.

### Why are bit-level operations important in C?

Bit-level operations are essential for low-level programming tasks, such as manipulating individual bits in data structures, working with hardware registers, or implementing efficient algorithms that rely on bitwise operations.

### Can you provide an example of bit-level operations in C?
Here are some examples of expression evaluation for data type char:

| C expression | Binary expression          | Binary result | Hexadecimal result |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| ~0x41        | ~[0100 0001]               | [1011 1110]   | 0xBE               |
| ~0x00        | ~[0000 0000]               | [1111 1111]   | 0xFF               |
| 0x69 & 0x55  | [0110 1001] & [0101 0101]  | [0100 0001]   | 0x41               |
| 0x69 \| 0x55 | [0110 1001] \| [01010101] | [0111 1101]   | 0x7D               |

To determine the effect of a bit-level expression, expand the hexadecimal arguments to their binary representations, perform the operations in binary, and then convert back to hexadecimal.

## What is a masking operation?

A masking operation is a common use of bit-level operations in which a mask, a bit pattern, is used to select a specific set of bits within a word.  Bitwise AND is a common operation used for masking, but it is not the only one. Bitwise OR and bitwise XOR can also be used for masking depending on the specific requirements of the operation.

### Can you provide an example of a masking operation?

Consider the mask `0xFF`, which has ones for the least significant 8 bits. This mask indicates the low-order byte of a word. The bit-level operation `x & 0xFF` yields a value consisting of the least significant byte of `x`, with all other bytes set to 0.

For example, if `x = 0x89ABCDEF`, the expression `x & 0xFF` would yield `0x000000EF`.
```
x             = 10001001101010111001110111101111 (0x89ABCDEF)
0xFF          = 00000000000000000000000011111111 (0xFF)

x & 0xFF      = 00000000000000000000000011101111 (0x000000EF)
```
### How can you create a mask of all ones regardless of the size of the data representation?

The expression `~0` will yield a mask of all ones, regardless of the size of the data representation. This expression is more portable than using a specific mask like `0xFFFFFFFF`, which assumes a 32-bit data type.

## How can XOR be used for an inplace_swap function in C?

The inplace_swap function is a technique for swapping two values without using a temporary variable. It uses the XOR operation to achieve the desired effect.
```c
void inplace_swap(int *x, int *y) {
    *y = *x ^ *y; /* Step 1 */
    *x = *x ^ *y; /* Step 2 */
    *y = *x ^ *y; /* Step 3 */
}
```
### Can you explain how the inplace_swap function works?

Let's start with values a and b in the locations pointed to by x and y, respectively. The table below shows the values stored at the two locations after each step of the procedure.

| Step | \*x | \*y |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| Initially | a | b |
| Step 1 | a | a \^ b |
| Step 2 | b | a \^ b |
| Step 3 | b | a |

Explanation:

-   In Step 1, `*y` becomes `a ^ b`.
-   In Step 2, `*x` becomes `a ^ (a ^ b)` which simplifies to `b`.
-   In Step 3, `*y` becomes `b ^ (a ^ b)` which simplifies to `a`.

Thus, the inplace_swap function swaps the values of `*x` and `*y` without using a temporary variable.

Here is a breakdown of the `inplace_swap` function using binary representations of the values involved:

Let's say we have two integers `a` and `b` with the binary values `a = 0101` and `b = 0011`. We pass the addresses of `a` and `b` to the `inplace_swap` function, so initially, `*x = a` and `*y = b`.

Step 1:

`*y = *x ^ *y    = 0101 ^ 0011    = 0110`

After step 1, `*x = a` and `*y = 0110`.

Step 2:

`*x = *x ^ *y    = 0101 ^ 0110    = 0011`

After step 2, `*x = 0011` and `*y = 0110`.

Step 3:

`*y = *x ^ *y    = 0011 ^ 0110    = 0101`

After step 3, `*x = 0011` and `*y = 0101`, which means the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped.

Here are the C expressions in terms of variable x:

1.  `x & 0xFF`
    
    -   This expression masks x with the 8-bit value 0xFF, which has all ones in the least significant byte and zeroes everywhere else. The result is the least significant byte of x with all other bits set to 0.
    -   For x = 0x87654321 and w = 32, this expression evaluates to 0x00000021.
	To evaluate `x & 0xFF`, we first need to convert `x` to binary.

	`x = 0x87654321`
	
	In binary, `x` is:
	
	`10000111011001010100001100100001`
	
	Next, we need to convert `0xFF` to binary. `0xFF` is a hexadecimal number that represents 255 in decimal.
	
	`0xFF = 11111111`
	
	So, `0xFF` in binary is:
	
	`11111111`
	
	Now, we can perform the bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits:
     10000111011001010100001100100001
  & 00000000000000000000000011111111
  ----------------------------------
    00000000000000000000000000100001
The result is `0x00000021`, which is 33 in decimal.

	Therefore, `x & 0xFF` evaluates to `0x00000021`.

 
	
2. The expression `x ^ ~0xFF` satisfies the condition of "All but the least significant byte of x complemented, with the least significant byte left unchanged" as follows:

-   `~0xFF` (11111111111111111111111100000000) represents a mask of all ones except for the least significant byte, which is all zeros.
-   `x ^ ~0xFF` will complement all bits in `x` except for the least significant byte. This is because XORing any bit with 1 flips its value, while XORing it with 0 leaves it unchanged.
-   Since the least significant byte of `x` is all zeros in the `~0xFF` mask, it will be left unchanged by the XOR operation.
-   Therefore, the expression `x ^ ~0xFF` will complement all but the least significant byte of `x`, while leaving the least significant byte unchanged.

For example, if `x = 0x87654321`, then:

-   `~0xFF` is `0xFFFFFF00`.
-   `x ^ ~0xFF` is `(0x87654321) ^ (0xFFFFFF00)` which equals `0x789ABC21`.
-   The least significant byte of `x`, which is `0x21`, is left unchanged in the result.

3.  `x | 0xFF`
    
    -   This expression sets the least significant byte of x to all ones using the 8-bit value 0xFF, while leaving all other bytes of x unchanged.
    -   For x = 0x87654321 and w = 32, this expression evaluates to 0x876543FF.
