## What are logical operations in C?

Logical operations in C are a set of operators `||`, `&&`, and `!`, which correspond to the OR, AND, and NOT operations of logic. These operators are different from bit-level operations, as they treat any nonzero argument as representing true and argument 0 as representing false. Logical operations return either 1 or 0, indicating a result of true or false, respectively.

### Can you provide examples of logical operation evaluations in C?

Here are some examples of expression evaluation for logical operations:

-   `!0x41`
    -   Result: `0x00`
-   `!0x00`
    -   Result: `0x01`
-   `!!0x41`
    -   Result: `0x01`
-   `0x69 && 0x55`
    -   Result: `0x01`
-   `0x69 || 0x55`
    -   Result: `0x01`

### What is the difference between logical and bitwise operations in C?

A bitwise operation will have behavior matching that of its logical counterpart only in the special case in which the arguments are restricted to 0 or 1. For example, the bitwise AND operation `&` would behave like the logical AND operation `&&` if the arguments were either 0 or 1.

### What is the difference in evaluation between logical operators and bitwise operators in C?

Logical operators `&&` and `||` have short-circuit behavior, meaning they do not evaluate their second argument if the result of the expression can be determined by evaluating the first argument. This is different from their bitwise counterparts `&` and `|`, which always evaluate both arguments. For example:

-   The expression `a && 5/a` will never cause a division by zero.
-   The expression `p && *p++` will never cause the dereferencing of a null pointer.

1.  Using only bit-level and logical operations, write a C expression that is equivalent to `x == y`. In other words, it will return 1 when `x` and `y` are equal and 0 otherwise.
`!(x ^ y)`
The expression `x ^ y` will yield 0 only if x and y are equal. If x and y are not equal, then `x ^ y` will have some non-zero bits. The `!` operator will invert the bits of the result, so if `x` and `y` are equal, the result will be all ones (or `true`) and the `!` operator will return `0` (or `false`). If `x` and `y` are not equal, the result will be some non-zero value and the `!` operator will return `1` (or `true`). Therefore, the expression `!(x ^ y)` will return `1` if `x` and `y` are equal and `0` otherwise.
