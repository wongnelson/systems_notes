Write a function int_shifts_are_arithmetic() that yields 1 when run on a machine that uses arithmetic right shifts for data type int and yields 0 otherwise. Your code should work on a machine with any word size

```c
#include <limits.h>

int int_shifts_are_arithmetic() {
    int x = -1;
    return (x >> 1) == -1;
}
```

Explanation:

-   The right shift operator `>>` performs an arithmetic right shift if the data type of the operand is signed, and a logical right shift if the operand is unsigned.
-   The value of `-1` shifted right by 1 position is `-1` in an arithmetic right shift, but `INT_MAX` in a logical right shift.
-   Therefore, if the result of `x >> 1` is `-1`, it means the machine uses arithmetic right shifts for data type `int`, and the function returns 1.
-   Otherwise, the function returns 0.
