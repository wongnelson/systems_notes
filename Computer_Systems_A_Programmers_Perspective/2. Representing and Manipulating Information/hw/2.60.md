1.  Suppose we number the bytes in a w-bit word from 0 (least significant) to w/8 – 1 (most significant). Write code for the following C function, which will return an unsigned value in which byte `i` of argument `x` has been replaced by byte `b`:
    
    ```
    
    unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b);
    ```
    
    Here are some examples showing how the function should work:
    
    ```
    
    replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB) --> 0x12AB5678
    replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB) --> 0x123456AB
    ```

```c
unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b) {
    // clear the ith byte of x by shifting x left by 8 * i bits and ANDing with a mask
    x = (x & ~(0xff << (8 * i))) | (b << (8 * i));
    return x;
}
```
Let's consider the example `replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB)`. In binary, `0x12345678` can be represented as:

0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000

To clear the 2nd byte (the 3rd byte from the right), we first shift `0xff` to the left by `8 * 2` bits:

`1111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000`

The bitwise NOT of `0xff0000` is:

`0000 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111`

The result of ANDing `x` with the mask is:
`0001 0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0111 1000`
