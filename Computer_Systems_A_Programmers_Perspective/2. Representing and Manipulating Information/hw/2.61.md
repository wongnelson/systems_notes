1.  Write C expressions that evaluate to 1 when the following conditions are true and to 0 when they are false. Assume `x` is of type `int`.
    
    1.  Any bit of `x` equals 1.
        When `x` is equal to `0b00000000`, the expression `!~x` would evaluate as follows:
		```c
		~0b00000000 = 0b11111111
		!0b11111111 = 0b00000000 = 0
		```
  So, in this case, the expression `!~x` would evaluate to `0`.

Now, let's consider a case where `x` is equal to `0b00000010`:
```c
~0b00000010 = 0b11111101
!0b11111101 = 0b00000010 = 1
```

    1.  Any bit of `x` equals 0.
	!x
    3.  Any bit in the least significant byte of `x` equals 1.
	!~(x | ~0xff)
        
    4.  Any bit in the most significant byte of `x` equals 0.
        !((x >> ((sizeof(int)-1) << 3)) & 0xff)

1) 
assuming the size of int is 4bytes -   ((sizeof(int)-1) << 3) would be 3 << 3

The binary representation of 3 is "11". Shifting the bits to the left by 3 positions results in "11000", which is equal to 24 in decimal form.

In other words, "<<" is the left shift operator in binary, and it shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. Each position shift doubles the value.

there is a mathematical way to determine that 3 << 3 is 24.

The left shift operator "<<" is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the number of positions shifted. So, in this case:

3 << 3 = 3 * (2^3) = 3 * 8 = 24

So, the expression 3 << 3 can be mathematically simplified to 24.

2) In this case, `x` is shifted to the right by `24` bits, which is the equivalent of dividing `x` by `2^24`. This operation brings the most significant byte of `x` to the least significant position.
