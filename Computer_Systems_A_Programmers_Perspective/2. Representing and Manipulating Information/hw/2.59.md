### Write a C expression that will yield a word consisting of the least significant byte of `x` and the remaining bytes of `y`. For operands `x = 0x89ABCDEF` and `y = 0x76543210,` this would give `0x765432EF`.

q: what's the least significant byte of x?
a; it would be 0xEF

q; what would be "the remaining bytes" of y?
a; The value 0xFFFFFF00 has all its bits set to 1 except for the last 8 bits, which are set to 0. When we perform a bitwise AND between y and 0xFFFFFF00, only the bits that are set to 1 in both operands will be set to 1 in the result. All other bits will be set to 0.

So, the expression (y & 0xFFFFFF00) will give us the remaining bytes of y with the least significant byte set to 0.

Here's an example to illustrate this:
```c
y = 0b0111 0110 0101 0011 0010 0001 0000 0000
0xFFFFFF00 = 0b1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 00000000
y & 0xFFFFFF00 = 0b0111 0110 0101 0011 0010 0000 00000000
```
As you can see, the last 8 bits of the result have been set to 0, giving us the remaining bytes of `y` with the least significant byte set to 0

q; in little endian - where is the least significant bit stored?
a; in the lowest memory addresss

```c
unsigned int x = 0x89ABCDEF;
unsigned int y = 0x76543210;
unsigned int result = (y & 0xFFFFFF00) | (x & 0x000000FF);
```

This code will correctly extract the least significant byte of `x` and preserve its original value by using the expression `(x & 0x000000FF)`. It will also extract the remaining bytes of `y` using the expression `(y & 0xFFFFFF00)`. Finally, it will combine the two using the bitwise OR operator `|`, yielding the expected result of `0x765432EF`.
