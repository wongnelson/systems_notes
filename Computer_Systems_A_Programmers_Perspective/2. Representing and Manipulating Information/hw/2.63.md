Fill in code for the following C functions. Function `srl` performs a logical right shift using an arithmetic right shift (given by value `xsra`), followed by other operations not including right shifts or division. Function `sra` performs an arithmetic right shift using a logical right shift (given by value `xsrl`), followed by other operations not including right shifts or division. You may use the computation `8*sizeof(int)` to determine w, the number of bits in data type `int`. The shift amount `k` can range from `0` to w – 1.

```c
unsigned srl(unsigned x, int k) {
  unsigned xsra = (int) x >> k;

  int w = sizeof(int) << 3;
  int mask = (int) -1 << (w - k);
  return xsra & ~mask;
}
```

q; why would you perform a logical right shift using an arithmetic right shift for preserving the sign of the number being shifted. won't JUST an arithmetic shift do that anyways
a; Yes, you are correct. An arithmetic right shift will preserve the sign of the number being shifted. So, there is no need to perform a logical right shift using an arithmetic right shift for preserving the sign of the number.

The `srl` function is an example of a more general approach to performing a logical right shift, in which the behavior of the shift operation is defined by the function, rather than relying on the underlying platform or compiler. This approach can be useful in certain situations where it is desired to have a consistent and portable way of performing a logical right shift.

In other words, by using the `srl` function, the behavior of the logical right shift can be defined in a single place, rather than relying on the behavior of the right shift operator `>>` in different compilers or platforms. This can help to ensure that the shift operation behaves consistently across different systems and can make the code more portable.

q; why is the mask needed?
a; The mask created in the `srl` function is used to clear the bits that were shifted in from the sign bit during the arithmetic shift.

Here's an example of the binary operations performed in the `srl` function for input `x = 0x12345678` and `k = 4`:

1.  First, the arithmetic right shift of `x` by `k` bits is performed, giving `xsra = 0x01234567`. In binary, `0x12345678` is `0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000` and after shifting right by 4 bits, we get `0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 0000` which is `0x01234567`.
    
2.  Next, the mask is calculated as `mask = (int) -1 << (w - k)`, where `w` is the number of bits in an `int` type. In this case, `w = 32`, so `mask = (int) -1 << (32 - 4) = (int) -1 << 28`. In binary, `-1` is represented as `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111`, so after shifting it left by 28 bits, we get `1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000`.
    
3.  The result of the bitwise negation of `mask` is calculated as `~mask = 0000 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111`.
    
4.  Finally, the result of the bitwise `and` operation between `xsra` and `~mask` is calculated as `xsra & ~mask = 0x01234567 & 0x0FFFFFFF = 0x01234567`.
    

The final result of the `srl` function is `0x01234567`, which is the result of a logical right shift of `0x12345678` by 4 bits.

q; -1 is represented as 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111, why?
-1 is represented as 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary form because it is the two's complement representation of the negative number -1 in a computer system using 32-bit signed integers.

In two's complement representation, the leftmost bit represents the sign of the number (0 for positive and 1 for negative). To get the two's complement representation of a negative number, we invert all the bits and add 1 to the result.

For example, in a 32-bit system, the binary representation of 0 is 00000000000000000000000000000000, to represent -1, we invert all the bits to get 11111111111111111111111111111111 and add 1 to the result to get 1000000000000000000000000000000000 which is the two's complement representation of -1.

q; for sra, why do we add the two lines?
```c
int sra(int x, int k) {
    int xsrl = (unsigned) x >> k;

    int w = sizeof(int) << 3;
    int mask = (int) -1 << (w - k);
    //let mask remain unchanged when the first bit of x is 1, otherwise 0.
    int m = 1 << (w - 1);
    mask &= ! (x & m) - 1;
    return xsrl | mask;
}
```

a; 
The two lines of code added to the `sra` function serve to modify the `mask` based on the most significant bit of `x`, which determines the sign of `x`.

1.  The `m` variable is calculated as `m = 1 << (w - 1)`, which is the binary representation of the most significant bit of an `int` type. In this case, `m = 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`.
Context: 
The variable `w` is calculated as `int w = sizeof(int) << 3;`, where `sizeof(int)` returns the number of bytes in an `int` type. The left bitwise shift `<< 3` multiplies the result by 8, giving the number of bits in an `int` type.

The `m` variable is calculated as `m = 1 << (w - 1)`, where `w` is the number of bits in an `int` type. This calculation is used to determine the binary representation of the most significant bit of an `int` type.

Here's how the calculation works:

1.  `1` is a binary representation of the number 1, with a single bit set to 1 and all other bits set to 0.
    
2.  `w - 1` calculates the number of bits to the right of the most significant bit in an `int` type. In this case, `w = 32`, so `w - 1 = 31`.
    
3.  `1 << (w - 1)` performs a left bitwise shift on `1` by `w - 1` bits. This sets the `w - 1` bit to the right of the most significant bit to 1, with all other bits set to 0. In binary, the result of this operation is `10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`.
    

The final result of the calculation, `m = 1 << (w - 1)`, is the binary representation of the most significant bit of an `int` type. In this case, `m = 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`.

So, in this case, `w = 4 << 3 = 32`, meaning that an `int` type is 32 bits.
    
2.  The mask is updated as `mask &= ! (x & m) - 1`. This operation first performs a bitwise `and` between `x` and `m` to determine if the most significant bit of `x` is set. If the most significant bit of `x` is set, the result of `x & m` will be non-zero, so `! (x & m)` will be 0. Subtracting 1 from 0 gives -1, so the `mask` remains unchanged. If the most significant bit of `x` is not set, the result of `x & m` will be 0, so `! (x & m)` will be 1. Subtracting 1 from 1 gives 0, so the `mask` is set to 0.
    

These two lines of code modify the `mask` based on the most significant bit of `x`, allowing the `sra` function to perform an arithmetic right shift. The result of the arithmetic right shift will depend on the sign of `x`, as specified by the most significant bit. If the most significant bit of `x` is set, the result will be an arithmetic right shift. If the most significant bit of `x` is not set, the result will be a logical right shift.
