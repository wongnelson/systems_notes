Write code to implement the following function:

```c

/*
 * Generate mask indicating leftmost 1 in x. Assume w=32.
 * For example, 0xFF00 -> 0x8000, and 0x6600 -> 0x4000.
 * If x = 0, then return 0.
 */
int leftmost_one(unsigned x);
```

0xFF00 is represented as 11111111 00000000.
The mask indicating the leftmost 1 in 0xFF00 would be 0x8000, which is represented as 10000000 00000000 in binary.

solution:
```c
int leftmost_one(unsigned x) {
  x |= x >> 1;
  x |= x >> 2;
  x |= x >> 4;
  x |= x >> 8;
  x |= x >> 16;
  return x - (x >> 1);
}

```
This code takes advantage of the fact that when you perform a right shift and then an OR operation, it fills in the leftmost bits with ones up to the position of the leftmost one in the original value. By doing this multiple times with different shift values, we can generate a value that has all the bits set to the right of the original leftmost one set to 1. Subtracting this value from the original value gives us a mask with only the leftmost one set to 1.
