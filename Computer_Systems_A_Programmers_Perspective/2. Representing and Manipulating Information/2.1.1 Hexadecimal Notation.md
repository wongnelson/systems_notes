## What is hexadecimal notation and why is it used?

Hexadecimal notation is a method of representing binary numbers in a base-16 format using digits 0-9 and letters A-F. Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a group of four bits in a binary number, which makes it a convenient shorthand for representing binary patterns. It is used in programming and computer systems because it is easier to read and write than binary or decimal notation, and it takes up less space than binary.

For example, the binary number 10011010 can be represented in hexadecimal as 9A. Using hexadecimal notation, we can represent large binary numbers using a shorter and more manageable notation.

## How are hexadecimal numbers written in C programming language?

In the C programming language, hexadecimal numbers are written as numeric constants starting with "0x" or "0X". The letters A through F can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the hexadecimal number FA1D37B16 can be written in C as 0xFA1D37B or 0xfa1d37b, or even with mixed cases such as 0xFa1D37b.

## How do you convert a hexadecimal number to binary?

To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, you can expand each hexadecimal digit into its binary equivalent. Each hexadecimal digit represents a group of four bits, so you can replace each digit with its corresponding binary value. For example, the hexadecimal number 0x173A4C can be converted to binary as follows:
| Hexadecimal | 1   | 7   | 3   | A   | 4   | C   |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Binary      | 0001| 0111| 0011| 1010| 0100| 1100|

Therefore, the binary representation of the hexadecimal number 0x173A4C is 000101110011101001001100.

## How do you convert a binary number to hexadecimal?

To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, you can split the binary number into groups of four bits each. If the total number of bits is not a multiple of 4, you should make the leftmost group be the one with fewer than 4 bits, effectively padding the number with leading zeros. Then you can translate each group of four bits into the corresponding hexadecimal digit using the chart shown in Figure 2.2. For example, the binary number 1111001010110110110011 can be converted to hexadecimal as follows:

Therefore, the hexadecimal representation of the binary number 1111001010110110110011 is 0x3CADB3.

| Binary       | 11  | 1100 | 1010 | 1101 | 1011 | 0011 |
| ------------ | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hexadecimal | 3   | C    | A    | D    | B    | 3    |

## What are decimal numbers?
Decimal numbers are a type of numerical system that are used to represent numbers in everyday life. In the decimal system, numbers are represented using the digits 0 to 9 and the position of each digit represents a power of 10. For example, the number 123 represents 1 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 3 * 1, while the number 3.14 represents 3 + 1/10 + 4/100. The decimal system is also known as the base-10 system, as it uses 10 symbols to represent numbers.

| 0       | 0000 0000    | 0x00        |
| 167     | 1010 0111    | 0xA7        |

### **Decimal to bin:**
To convert the decimal number 62 to binary, we can use the following method:

-   Divide the decimal number by 2 and write down the remainder.
-   Divide the quotient (the result of the previous division) by 2 and write down the remainder.
-   Continue dividing the quotient by 2 and writing down the remainder until the quotient becomes 0.
-   Write down the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation.

Using this method, we can convert 62 to binary as follows:
62 / 2 = 31 remainder 0
31 / 2 = 15 remainder 1
15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1
7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1
3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

Therefore, the binary representation of the decimal number 62 is 111110 

### bin to dec:
1     1     1     1     1     0
2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0

32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 62
