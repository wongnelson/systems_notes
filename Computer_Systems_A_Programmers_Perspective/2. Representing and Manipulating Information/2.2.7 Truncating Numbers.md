## How does truncating numbers work in programming languages?

Truncating a number means reducing the number of bits used to represent a number. In programming languages, this can happen when casting a larger data type to a smaller one. Consider the following code snippet:
```c
int x = 53191;
short sx = (short) x;  // -12345
int y = sx;            // -12345
```
In this example, casting the 32-bit `int` to a 16-bit `short` truncates the higher-order bits, causing the two's-complement representation of the number to change. When casting back to `int`, sign extension is applied, yielding the 32-bit two's-complement representation of -12,345.

## What is the principle of truncating an unsigned number?

When truncating a `w`-bit unsigned number `x` to a `k`-bit unsigned number, we drop the high-order `w - k` bits. The numeric value that results can be expressed as:

`x' = x mod 2^k`

The intuition behind this principle is that all the bits that were truncated have weights of the form `2^i`, where `i >= k`, and therefore each of these weights reduces to zero under the modulus operation.

## How does truncating a two's-complement number work?

Truncating a two's-complement number involves dropping the high-order bits like with an unsigned number, but it also converts the most significant bit into a sign bit. Let `x` be a `w`-bit two's-complement number and `x'` be the result of truncating it to `k` bits. Then:

`x' = U2Tk(x mod 2^k)`

In this case, `x mod 2^k` will be a number between `0` and `2^k - 1`. Applying function `U2Tk` to it will have the effect of converting the most significant bit `xk-1` from having weight `2^(k-1)` to having weight `-2^(k-1)`.

For example, converting the value `x = 53191` from `int` to `short`, since `2^16 = 65536 >= x`, we have `x mod 2^16 = x`. But when we convert this number to a 16-bit two's-complement number, we get `x' = 53191 - 65536 = -12345`.

## How does truncation affect unsigned and two's-complement numbers?

For unsigned numbers, truncation can be expressed as:

`B2Uk([xk-1, xk-2, ..., x0]) = B2Uw([xw-1, xw-2, ..., x0]) mod 2^k`

For two's-complement numbers, truncation can be expressed as:

`B2Tk([xk-1, xk-2, ..., x0]) = B2Uw(B2Uw([xw-1, xw-2, ..., x0]) mod 2^k)`

In both cases, truncation can lead to changes in the numeric value of a number, which is a form of overflow.
