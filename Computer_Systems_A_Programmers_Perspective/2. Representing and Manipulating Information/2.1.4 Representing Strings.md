## What is a string in C and how is it represented?

A string in C is represented as an array of characters terminated by the null character (having the value 0). Each character in the string is encoded using a standard encoding, with the most common encoding being the ASCII character code.

### Can you provide an example?

Consider the following string in C:

`char example_string[] = "12345";`

When we run a `show_bytes` routine with the argument "12345" and 6 (to include the terminating character), we get the output:

`31 32 33 34 35 00`

In memory, the characters '1', '2', '3', '4', and '5' are represented by the byte values `0x31`, `0x32`, `0x33`, `0x34`, and `0x35`.

Here, the ASCII code for the decimal digit `x` happens to be `0x3x`, and the terminating byte has the hex representation `0x00`.

## How does the representation of strings in C affect platform independence?

The representation of strings in C, using the ASCII character code, allows text data to be more platform-independent than binary data. The same result is obtained on any system using ASCII as its character code, regardless of the byte ordering and word size conventions.

### Why is platform independence important?

Platform independence is crucial for ensuring that the same code can be executed on different systems without modification. It simplifies the development process and increases the portability of code across various platforms.

### Can you provide an example of platform independence in string representation?

As mentioned earlier, the string "12345" has the following byte representation on any system using ASCII as its character code:

`31 32 33 34 35 00`

This byte representation will be the same on systems with different byte orderings and word sizes, such as little-endian, big-endian, 32-bit, or 64-bit machines. This consistency allows developers to work with strings more easily across different platforms, without having to worry about the underlying system's architecture.

### What would be printed as a result of the following call to show_bytes? const char *s = “abcdef”; show_bytes((byte_pointer) s, strlen(s));

The `show_bytes` function takes a starting memory address `start` and a length `len` as inputs, and prints out the byte values at each memory location, in hexadecimal format, using the `printf` function.

In the given code, `s` is a pointer to a constant character string that contains the value "abcdef". The `strlen` function is used to determine the length of the string, which is 6 in this case.

When the `show_bytes` function is called with the starting address of `s` and a length of 6, it prints out the byte values of the string in hexadecimal format, one byte at a time. Since the string contains only ASCII characters, each character is represented by one byte, with the high-order byte set to 0.

Therefore, the output of the `show_bytes` function for this code would be ``61 62 63 64 65 66``

This indicates that the memory locations for the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f' contain the byte values `0x61`, `0x62`, `0x63`, `0x64`, `0x65`, and `0x66`, respectively.
