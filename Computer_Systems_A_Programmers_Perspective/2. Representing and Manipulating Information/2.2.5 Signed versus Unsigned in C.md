## How does C support signed and unsigned arithmetic for integer data types?

C supports both signed and unsigned arithmetic for all its integer data types. By default, most numbers are considered signed. For example, when declaring a constant such as `12345` or `0x1A2B`, the value is considered signed. To create an unsigned constant, you can add a 'U' or 'u' suffix, like `12345U` or `0x1A2Bu`.

## How does C handle conversion between unsigned and signed integers?

C allows conversion between unsigned and signed integers. Most systems follow the rule that the underlying bit representation does not change when converting between signed and unsigned integers. This means that the function `U2Tw` is applied when converting from unsigned to signed, and `T2Uw` when converting from signed to unsigned, where `w` is the number of bits for the data type.

### How do explicit casting and implicit casting work in C?

Conversions can happen due to explicit casting, such as in the following code:
```c
int tx, ty;
unsigned ux, uy;

tx = (int) ux;
uy = (unsigned) ty;
```
Alternatively, they can happen implicitly when an expression of one type is assigned to a variable of another, as in the following code:
```c
int tx, ty;
unsigned ux, uy;

tx = ux; /* Cast to signed */
uy = ty; /* Cast to unsigned */
```
## How are numeric values printed with `printf`?

When printing numeric values with `printf`, the directives `%d`, `%u`, and `%x` are used to print a number as a signed decimal, an unsigned decimal, and in hexadecimal format, respectively. Note that `printf` does not make use of any type information, so it is possible to print a value of type `int` with directive `%u` and a value of type `unsigned` with directive `%d`.

## What nonintuitive behavior arises due to C's handling of expressions containing combinations of signed and unsigned quantities?

When an operation is performed where one operand is signed and the other is unsigned, C implicitly casts the signed argument to unsigned and performs the operations assuming the numbers are nonnegative. This convention makes little difference for standard arithmetic operations but leads to nonintuitive results for relational operators such as `<` and `>`.

Here's an example of how the implicit casting of signed arguments to unsigned can lead to nonintuitive results for relational operators such as `<` and `>`:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = -1;
    unsigned int y = 1;
    if (x < y) {
        printf("x is less than y\n");
    } else {
        printf("x is not less than y\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we declare a signed integer variable `x` with the value `-1`, and an unsigned integer variable `y` with the value `1`. We then use the relational operator `<` to compare `x` and `y`.

Since the operands of the `<` operator have different types, C implicitly casts `x` to an unsigned integer and assumes that the numbers are nonnegative. However, the two's complement representation of `-1` as a 32-bit signed integer is `0xFFFFFFFF`, which is greater than `1` as an unsigned integer. Therefore, the expression `x < y` evaluates to `false`, and the program outputs `x is not less than y`.

This behavior can be surprising and counterintuitive, especially when working with mixed signed and unsigned types in C. To avoid such issues, it is recommended to use explicit casts or to use the same type for all operands of a relational operator.

### Can you provide an example of nonintuitive behavior with relational operators?

Consider the comparison `-1 < 0U`. Since the second operand is unsigned, the first one is implicitly cast to unsigned, and hence the expression is equivalent to the comparison `4294967295U < 0U` (recall that `T2Uw(-1) = UMaxw`), which is false. The other cases can be understood by similar analyses.
