## Q: What is the purpose of a page table in a virtual memory system?

A: A page table is a data structure stored in physical memory in a virtual memory system that maps virtual pages to physical pages. The address translation hardware reads the page table each time it converts a virtual address to a physical address. The operating system is responsible for maintaining the contents of the page table and transferring pages back and forth between disk and DRAM.

## Q: What is the structure of a page table?

A: A page table is an array of page table entries (PTEs), with each page in the virtual address space having a PTE at a fixed offset in the page table. Each PTE consists of a valid bit and an n-bit address field. The valid bit indicates whether the virtual page is currently cached in DRAM. If the valid bit is set, the address field indicates the start of the corresponding physical page in DRAM where the virtual page is cached. If the valid bit is not set, then a null address indicates that the virtual page has not yet been allocated. Otherwise, the address points to the start of the virtual page on disk.

```c
 __________
| Page Table |
|____________|
  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |
  v  v  v  v

Array of PTEs:
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| PTE 1     | PTE 2     | PTE 3     | PTE 4     |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

Each PTE consists of:
+-----------+-----------+
| Valid Bit | Address   |
+-----------+-----------+

Valid Bit:
+-----------+
| 0 or 1    |
+-----------+
  0 = Virtual page not in DRAM
  1 = Virtual page in DRAM

Address:
+-----------+
| n-bit     |
+-----------+
  If valid bit = 1, indicates start of corresponding physical page in DRAM
  If valid bit = 0, 
    if null address, virtual page has not been allocated
    else, points to start of virtual page on disk

^ shows the basic organization of a page table. A page table is an array of _page table entries (PTEs)._ Each page in the virtual address space has a PTE at a fixed offset in the page table. For our purposes, we will assume that each PTE consists of a _valid bit_ and an n-bit address field. The valid bit indicates whether the virtual page is currently cached in DRAM. If the valid bit is set, the address field indicates the start of the corresponding physical page in DRAM where the virtual page is cached. If the valid bit is not set, then a null address indicates that the virtual page has not yet been allocated. Otherwise, the address points to the start of the virtual page on disk.

The example in [Figure 9.4](https://reader.960960.xyz/#P700049702700000000000000000707C) shows a page table for a system with eight virtual pages and four physical pages. Four virtual pages (VP 1, VP 2, VP 4, and VP 7) are currently cached in DRAM. Two pages (VP 0 and VP 5) have not yet been allocated, and the rest (VP 3 and VP 6) have been allocated but are not currently cached. An important point to notice about [Figure 9.4](https://reader.960960.xyz/#P700049702700000000000000000707C) is that because the DRAM cache is fully associative, any physical page can contain any virtual page.
## Q: Why is the valid bit important in a PTE?

A: The valid bit in a PTE is important because it indicates whether the virtual page is currently cached in DRAM. If the valid bit is set, it means that the virtual page is stored in DRAM and the address field in the PTE will indicate the start of the corresponding physical page in DRAM. If the valid bit is not set, it means that the virtual page is not stored in DRAM and the operating system will need to retrieve it from disk before it can be used. This allows the virtual memory system to keep track of which pages are currently stored in DRAM and which pages need to be retrieved from disk, improving overall system performance.


## why is `2^n / P` is used to determine the number of page table entries (PTEs)

The formula `2^n / P` is used to determine the number of page table entries (PTEs) because it takes into account both the size of the virtual address space and the page size.

The virtual address space is the range of addresses that can be used by a process in a virtual memory system. The size of the virtual address space is determined by `n`, which is the number of bits used to represent a virtual address. With `n` bits, there are 2^n possible virtual addresses.

The page size is the size of a block of memory that is mapped to a single page table entry. In other words, each page table entry maps to a page in physical memory, and the size of that page is defined by `P` in bytes.

So, by dividing the size of the virtual address space by the page size, we can determine the number of pages needed to represent the entire virtual address space. And since each page is mapped to a single page table entry, the number of PTEs is equal to the number of pages. Hence, the formula `2^n / P` is used to determine the number of PTEs.

The value of `n` in the formula `2^n / P` is determined by the maximum size of the virtual address space that a system can support.

In other words, `n` is the number of bits used to represent a virtual address in a virtual memory system. The larger the value of `n`, the larger the virtual address space, and the more memory that can be addressed by a process.

For example, if `n` is 16 bits, the virtual address space would be limited to 2^16, or 65,536 addresses. On the other hand, if `n` is 32 bits, the virtual address space would be limited to 2^32, or 4,294,967,296 addresses.

The value of `n` is usually determined by the architecture of the computer system, and it can vary depending on the type of system and the operating system used. For example, on a 32-bit architecture, `n` would typically be 32, while on a 64-bit architecture, `n` would typically be 64.

It's important to note that while larger values of `n` allow for larger virtual address spaces, they also require more memory to store the page table, which maps virtual pages to physical pages in the virtual memory system.
