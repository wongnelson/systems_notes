##  Why are implicit free lists called that?
"Implicit free lists" earn their name from the way they operate. Unlike some systems that maintain a distinct data structure to keep track of unallocated blocks within the heap, implicit free lists do not. Rather, these systems implicitly interconnect the free blocks by recording the block size within each block's header. This method allows the allocator to navigate the heap by analyzing the headers of each block, skipping over those that are already allocated until it discovers an available block. Since the connection of the free blocks doesn't rely on an independent data structure, the free list is deemed "implicit".


## Question 1: What is an implicit free list in memory allocators?

**Answer**: An implicit free list is a data structure used by memory allocators to distinguish block boundaries and differentiate between allocated and free blocks. It organizes the heap as a sequence of contiguous allocated and free blocks, embedding the block size and allocation status information in the blocks themselves.

## Question 2: How is a block organized in an implicit free list?

**Answer**: A block in an implicit free list consists of a one-word header, the payload, and possibly some additional padding. The header encodes the block size (including the header and any padding) and whether the block is allocated or free.

Look at example in book

### Block Header Example

When we have an allocated block with a block size of 24 bytes, the binary representation of the block size is as follows:

`0x18 (24 in hexadecimal) = 0001 1000 in binary`

Since we need to store the allocated/free status of the block as well, we use the least significant bit (LSB) of the block header to store this information. The LSB is the rightmost bit in the binary representation. In this case, since the block is allocated, we set the LSB to 1:

`0001 1000 | 0000 0001 = 0001 1001`

Now, the block header becomes:

`0x00000019 (25 in hexadecimal)`

So, when a block has a size of 24 bytes and is allocated, its header will be 0x00000019. The size information and the allocation status are combined in the header, making it easy for the allocator to manage the block.

The book does this:
`0x00000018 | 0x1 = 0x00000019`

For a free block with a block size of 40 (0x28) bytes, the header would be:

`0x00000028 | 0x0 = 0x00000028`

### Importance of Padding

The padding might be part of an allocator's strategy for combating external fragmentation or needed to satisfy the alignment requirement.

Let's consider an example to understand the importance of padding in a memory allocator.

Imagine an application requests a block of size 15 bytes. The system imposes a double-word alignment requirement, meaning that each block's size must be a multiple of 8 bytes.

### Padding for Alignment Requirements

Without padding, the 15-byte block would not satisfy the double-word alignment requirement. To meet this requirement, the allocator adds padding to round up the block size to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes. In this case, the allocator would add 1 byte of padding, resulting in a total block size of 16 bytes:
```c
+----------------+-----------------+----------+
| Block Header   | Payload (15B)   | Padding  |
| (size/alloc bit) | (requested data) | (1 byte) |
+----------------+-----------------+----------+
```
### Padding for Combating External Fragmentation

Now, let's say the allocator has the following memory layout:
```c
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------------+
| Small1   | Small2   |  Free  | Medium   | Block4 |
| (Block1) | (Block2) |        | (Block3) |        |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------------+
```
Now, let's say the application requests a medium-sized block of 20 bytes, and the allocator finds that the free block can accommodate the request. However, the size of the free block is 22 bytes.

After allocating the requested 20-byte block, there will be a 2-byte chunk of memory left. This small chunk of memory becomes a free block between the newly allocated block and Block3.
```c
+--------+--------+------+----+--------+---------+
| Small1 | Small2 | New  |Free| Medium  | Block4 |
|(Block1)| (Block2)|(20B)|(2B)| (Block3)|        |
+--------+--------+------+----+--------+---------+
```
In this situation, the allocator might decide to add padding to the newly allocated block to fully occupy the original free block (22 bytes), effectively reducing fragmentation. By doing so, the allocator can avoid leaving small, unusable chunks of memory in between allocated blocks, which contributes to more efficient memory management.
## Question 3: How does an allocator traverse the implicit free list?

**Answer**: The allocator can traverse the implicit free list indirectly by traversing all of the blocks in the heap, as free blocks are linked implicitly by the size fields in the headers. A specially marked end block, such as a terminating header with the allocated bit set and a size of zero, is needed to mark the end of the list.

## Question 4: What are the advantages and disadvantages of an implicit free list?

**Answer**:

### Advantages

1.  Simplicity: The implicit free list is easy to implement and understand.

### Disadvantages

1.  Costly operations: The cost of any operation that requires a search of the free list, such as placing allocated blocks, will be linear in the total number of allocated and free blocks in the heap.

## Question 5: How does the system's alignment requirement and the allocator's choice of block format impose a minimum block size?

**Answer**: The system's alignment requirement and the allocator's choice of block format determine the minimum block size that can be allocated or freed. For example, assuming a double-word alignment requirement, the size of each block must be a multiple of two words (8 bytes). The block format, in this case, induces a minimum block size of two words: one word for the header and another to maintain the alignment requirement.

### Example

Even if the application requests a single byte, the allocator would still create a two-word block due to the alignment requirement and block format constraints.

### 9.6 
| Request | Block size (decimal bytes) | Block header (hex) |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| malloc(1) |   |   |
| malloc(5) |   |   |
| malloc(12) |   |   |
| malloc(13) |   |   |

The block format contains two parts: the header and the payload. The header contains the size and status of the block, as well as any other metadata required by the allocator. The payload contains the user-requested data.

In this problem, we are assuming double-word alignment, which means that each block must be aligned on an 8-byte boundary. Therefore, the size of each block must be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes to ensure proper alignment.

Let's go through each malloc request and calculate the block size and header value:

1.  malloc(1): The requested payload size is 1 byte. The header size is 4 bytes (for the size and status fields). Therefore, the total size is 1 + 4 = 5 bytes. We need to round up to the nearest multiple of 8, which is 8. Therefore, the block size is 8 bytes. The header value is calculated as follows:

-   Set the lowest bit to 1 to indicate that the block is allocated.
-   Set the remaining bits to the block size (8) divided by the minimum block size (8), minus 1. This gives us 0, since 8/8 - 1 = 0.

Therefore, the header value is 0x9 (binary 1001).

2.  malloc(5): The requested payload size is 5 bytes. The header size is 4 bytes. Therefore, the total size is 5 + 4 = 9 bytes. We need to round up to the nearest multiple of 8, which is 16. Therefore, the block size is 16 bytes. The header value is calculated as follows:

-   Set the lowest bit to 1 to indicate that the block is allocated.
-   Set the remaining bits to the block size (16) divided by the minimum block size (8), minus 1. This gives us 1, since 16/8 - 1 = 1.

Therefore, the header value is 0x11 (binary 0001 0001).

3.  malloc(12): The requested payload size is 12 bytes. The header size is 4 bytes. Therefore, the total size is 12 + 4 = 16 bytes. We need to round up to the nearest multiple of 8, which is 16. Therefore, the block size is 16 bytes. The header value is calculated in the same way as for malloc(5):

-   Set the lowest bit to 1 to indicate that the block is allocated.
-   Set the remaining bits to the block size (16) divided by the minimum block size (8), minus 1. This gives us 1, since 16/8 - 1 = 1.

Therefore, the header value is 0x11 (binary 0001 0001).

4.  malloc(13): The requested payload size is 13 bytes. The header size is 4 bytes. Therefore, the total size is 13 + 4 = 17 bytes. We need to round up to the nearest multiple of 8, which is 24. Therefore, the block size is 24 bytes. The header value is calculated in the same way as for malloc(1):

-   Set the lowest bit to 1 to indicate that the block is allocated.
-   Set the remaining bits to the block size (24) divided by the minimum block size (8), minus 1. This gives us 2, since 24/8 - 1 = 2.

	Therefore, the header value is 0x19 (binary 0001 1001).
