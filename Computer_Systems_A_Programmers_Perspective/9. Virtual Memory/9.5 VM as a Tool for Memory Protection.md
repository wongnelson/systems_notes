### What is the function of PTEs in memory protection?

Page Table Entries (PTEs) are used to control access to the contents of a virtual page. The address translation hardware reads a PTE each time the CPU generates an address. By adding some additional permission bits to the PTE, it is possible to control access to the contents of a virtual page.

### What are the three permission bits used to control access to virtual pages in a computer system?

The three permission bits used to control access to virtual pages are:

-   SUP (Supervisor) bit: indicates whether processes must be running in kernel (supervisor) mode to access the page.
-   READ bit: controls read access to the page.
-   WRITE bit: controls write access to the page.

### What happens when an instruction violates the permission bits for accessing virtual pages?

If an instruction violates the permission bits for accessing virtual pages, the CPU triggers a general protection fault that transfers control to an exception handler in the kernel. The exception handler then sends a SIGSEGV signal to the offending process. In Linux shells, this exception is typically reported as a "segmentation fault."

Example:
Consider a process running in user mode.
If SUP = 0, READ = 1 and WRITE = 1 for a virtual page, the process has permission to read and write to that page.
If SUP = 1, READ = 1 and WRITE = 0 for a virtual page, the process is not allowed to access that page as it is running in user mode and the SUP bit is set to 1.

### Why is it important to control access to virtual pages in a computer system?

Controlling access to virtual pages is important to ensure the security and stability of a computer system. A user process should not be allowed to modify its read-only code section or any of the code and data structures in the kernel. It should not be allowed to read or write the private memory of other processes, and it should not be allowed to modify any virtual pages that are shared with other processes, unless all parties explicitly allow it. Memory protection ensures that each process has its own virtual address space and that it can only access its own memory, preventing one process from interfering with another.
