### What is physical addressing?

Physical addressing refers to a method where the CPU accesses main memory using physical addresses (PA). In this approach, the main memory of a computer system is organized as an array of M contiguous byte-size cells, with each byte having a unique physical address. For example, the first byte has an address of 0, the next byte an address of 1, and so on.

### What is an example of physical addressing in a load instruction?

The CPU accesses memory using a load instruction and generates an effective physical address. The load instruction reads the 4-byte word starting at physical address 4. When the CPU executes the load instruction, it passes the physical address to main memory over the memory bus. The main memory fetches the 4-byte word starting at physical address 4 and returns it to the CPU, which stores it in a register.

### Where is physical addressing used?

Physical addressing is used in early PCs and continues to be used in systems such as digital signal processors, embedded microcontrollers.

### What is virtual addressing?

Virtual addressing is a method where the CPU accesses main memory using virtual addresses (VA) which are then converted to physical addresses before being sent to main memory. The task of converting a virtual address to a physical one is known as address translation.

### How does virtual addressing work?

In virtual addressing, the CPU generates a virtual address which is then translated to the appropriate physical address by the memory management unit (MMU) on the CPU chip. The MMU uses a lookup table stored in main memory, the contents of which are managed by the operating system.

### What is the role of the operating system in virtual addressing?

The operating system plays a crucial role in virtual addressing as it manages the contents of the lookup table stored in main memory. The table is used by the MMU to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses on the fly.

### Why is virtual addressing used in modern processors?

Virtual addressing is used in modern processors as it provides several advantages over physical addressing. For example, virtual addressing allows for better memory management, protection, and sharing of memory resources. It also enables the operating system to create the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space for each process, even if the physical memory is fragmented or sparse.
