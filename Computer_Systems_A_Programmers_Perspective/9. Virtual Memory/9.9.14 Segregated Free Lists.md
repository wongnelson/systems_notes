## How do segregated free lists work?

Segregated free lists are an approach to reduce allocation time in memory allocation by maintaining multiple free lists, with each list holding blocks of roughly the same size. This method is known as segregated storage.

### What are size classes?

Size classes are equivalence classes that partition the set of all possible block sizes. There are many ways to define size classes, such as partitioning by powers of 2 or assigning small blocks to their own size classes and partitioning large blocks by powers of 2.

### How does the allocator use size classes?

The allocator maintains an array of free lists, with one free list per size class, ordered by increasing size. When the allocator needs a block of size `n`, it searches the appropriate free list. If it cannot find a block that fits, it searches the next list, and so on.

### What is simple segregated storage?

Simple segregated storage is a basic approach to segregated storage where the free list for each size class contains same-size blocks, each the size of the largest element of the size class. Allocation and freeing of blocks are both fast constant-time operations, but this method can lead to internal and external fragmentation.

#### What are the advantages of simple segregated storage?

1.  Fast allocation and freeing of blocks: Both operations are constant-time.
2.  Low per-block memory overhead: Since each chunk has only same-size blocks, the size of an allocated block can be inferred from its address. Allocated blocks require no headers and footers. Free blocks need only a one-word `succ` pointer, resulting in a minimum block size of one word.

#### What are the disadvantages of simple segregated storage?

1.  Internal fragmentation: Free blocks are never split, which can result in wasted memory within blocks.
2.  External fragmentation: Free blocks are never coalesced, which can cause fragmentation between blocks when certain reference patterns are used.

### What are some other variants of segregated storage?

There are dozens of variants of segregated storage described in the dynamic storage allocation literature. These variants differ in how they define size classes, when they perform coalescing, when they request additional heap memory from the operating system, whether they allow splitting, and more. Segregated fits is another basic approach to segregated storage.

## Practice problem 9.10
1.  Describe a reference pattern that results in severe external fragmentation in an allocator based on simple segregated storage.

A: 

In an allocator based on simple segregated storage, a reference pattern that can cause severe external fragmentation is one where memory is allocated and freed in alternating sizes, causing the allocator to repeatedly switch between different size classes.

Consider the following example:

1.  Allocate a large number of small blocks (e.g., size 8).
2.  Allocate a large number of medium-sized blocks (e.g., size 64).
3.  Free a portion of the small blocks allocated in step 1.
4.  Allocate a large number of large blocks (e.g., size 256).

At this point, we have a mix of small, medium, and large blocks in memory. Since the allocator using simple segregated storage does not coalesce free blocks, the freed small blocks from step 3 remain separate, and the memory becomes fragmented.

Now, let's say we need to allocate a new block of size 128:

5.  Try to allocate a block of size 128.

In this case, the allocator is unable to find a suitable free block of size 128, even though there may be enough free memory in the small blocks combined. The allocator would need to request more memory from the operating system, leading to wasted memory and external fragmentation.

This pattern of alternating allocation and deallocation of different-sized blocks can lead to severe external fragmentation in an allocator based on simple segregated storage, as the allocator is unable to merge free blocks of different size classes to satisfy allocation requests.


## Segregated Fits
## What is segregated fits?

Segregated fits is a memory allocation approach where an allocator maintains an array of free lists, with each free list associated with a size class. Each list contains potentially different-sized blocks whose sizes are members of the size class. It is a popular choice for production-quality allocators, such as the GNU malloc package in the C standard library, due to its speed and memory efficiency.

## How does the segregated fits allocator allocate a block?

When allocating a block, the segregated fits allocator performs the following steps:

1.  Determine the size class of the requested block.
2.  Perform a first-fit search of the appropriate free list for a block that fits.
3.  If a fitting block is found, optionally split it and insert the fragment into the appropriate free list.
4.  If no fitting block is found, search the free list for the next larger size class and repeat the process.
5.  If none of the free lists yields a block that fits, request additional heap memory from the operating system, allocate the block from the new heap memory, and place the remainder in the appropriate size class.

Here's a simple ASCII art example to help visualize how a segregated fits memory allocator works:
```c
Size Classes:       8 bytes     16 bytes    32 bytes

Free Lists:    |-----------| |-----------| |-----------|
               |   Block1  | |   Block1  | |   Block1  |
               |-----------| |-----------| |-----------|
               |   Block2  | |   Block2  | |   Block2  |
               |-----------| |-----------| |-----------|
               |   Block3  | |           | |           |
               |-----------| |           | |           |
```

In this example, we have three size classes: 8 bytes, 16 bytes, and 32 bytes. Each size class has its own free list containing blocks of memory.

When a memory request comes in, the allocator looks at the size of the requested memory and determines which size class it belongs to. For instance, if a request for 12 bytes of memory comes in, the allocator will look in the 16 bytes size class, since that is the smallest size class that can accommodate the request.

The allocator then checks the free list for the appropriate size class. If there are available blocks, the allocator assigns one of the blocks to the request and removes it from the free list. If there are no available blocks, the allocator may request more memory from the operating system and add it to the free list before fulfilling the request.

When memory is deallocated, the allocator determines which size class the block belongs to and adds it back to the appropriate free list for future use.

This segregated fits strategy allows for fast allocation and deallocation, as well as efficient memory usage.


## How does the segregated fits allocator free a block?

To free a block, the segregated fits allocator coalesces the block with its adjacent free blocks and places the result on the appropriate free list. This helps reduce external fragmentation and improves overall memory utilization.

## Why is segregated fits a popular choice for memory allocators?

Segregated fits is a popular choice for memory allocators because it offers both speed and memory efficiency. By limiting searches to specific parts of the heap, search times are reduced compared to searching the entire heap. Additionally, memory utilization is improved, as a simple first-fit search of a segregated free list approximates a best-fit search of the entire heap. This leads to better overall memory management and reduced fragmentation.

## Buddy System
## What is a buddy system?

A buddy system is a specialized memory allocation approach, which is a special case of segregated fits where each size class is a power of 2. The buddy system is designed to allocate memory blocks efficiently while simplifying the coalescing process. Although it might not be suitable for general-purpose workloads due to internal fragmentation, it can be useful for application-specific workloads where block sizes are known to be powers of 2 in advance.

## How does the buddy system allocate memory blocks?

To allocate a block of size 2^k in a buddy system, the following steps are performed:

1.  Find the first available block of size 2^j, such that k ≤ j ≤ m (where m is the maximum power of 2).
2.  If j = k, the allocation is complete.
3.  If j > k, recursively split the block in half until j = k. Place each remaining half (buddy) on the appropriate free list.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the buddy system's allocation process. Suppose we have a heap with a size of 2^4 (16) words, and we want to allocate a block of size 2^2 (4) words. In this example, m = 4, and the heap initially contains one free block of size 2^4 (16) words. The steps for allocation would be:

1.  Find the first available block of size 2^j, such that k ≤ j ≤ m, where k = 2 and m = 4. In this case, we find a block of size 2^4 (16) words.
2.  Check if j = k, which means the block size is equal to the requested size. In this case, j = 4, and k = 2, so they are not equal.
3.  Since j > k, recursively split the block in half until j = k:
    -   First split: Two blocks of size 2^3 (8) words
    -   Second split (on one of the blocks of size 8): Two blocks of size 2^2 (4) words

At this point, we have a block of size 2^2 (4) words, which is the requested size. We can now allocate this block, and the remaining half (its buddy) is placed on the appropriate free list.

Here's an ASCII representation of the heap during the allocation process:

Initial heap (size 16):

`[                ]`

After the first split (two blocks of size 8):

`[        |        ]`

After the second split (two blocks of size 4, one of them allocated):

`[    |    |        ]`

Final heap state:

`[A   |    |        ]`

In the final heap state, "A" represents the allocated block of size 4 words, and there are two free blocks of size 4 and 8 words available for future allocations.

## How does the buddy system free memory blocks?

To free a block of size 2^k in a buddy system, coalesce the block with its free buddies. When an allocated buddy is encountered, stop the coalescing process. The buddy system's design simplifies the coalescing process by making it easy to compute the address of a block's buddy.

When we free a block of memory, the buddy system checks if the block's buddy is also free. If the buddy is free, the two blocks are combined into a single larger block of size 2^(k+1). This process continues until either an allocated buddy is encountered or the largest possible block size is reached.

For example, let's say we have a memory pool of size 2^3 = 8 bytes. We start by dividing the large block into two smaller blocks of size 2^2 = 4 bytes.
```c
Block 1 (size 4): [ ][ ][ ][ ]
Block 2 (size 4): [ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

Suppose we allocate Block 1 for a memory allocation of size 2. We now have two blocks of size 2:
```c
Block 1 (size 2): [X][X]
Block 2 (size 2): [ ][ ]
```
Now, if we free Block 2, its buddy (Block 1) is still allocated, so the coalescing process stops.

However, if we were to free Block 1 instead, the coalescing process would start. The two free blocks of size 2 would be combined into a single block of size 4:
```c
Block 1 (size 4): [ ][ ][ ][ ]
```
The buddy system makes it easy to compute the address of a block's buddy because each block has a fixed size and the memory is divided in a predictable manner. By knowing the size of the block and its starting address, we can easily calculate the address of its buddy.

## What is the major advantage of the buddy system?

The major advantage of the buddy system is its fast searching and coalescing capabilities. By using power-of-2 block sizes and maintaining separate free lists for each size, the buddy system simplifies the allocation and deallocation processes.

## What is the major disadvantage of the buddy system?

The major disadvantage of the buddy system is the potential for significant internal fragmentation due to the power-of-2 requirement on block sizes. This can lead to inefficient memory usage in situations where the allocated block sizes are not powers of 2. Consequently, buddy system allocators may not be suitable for general-purpose workloads but can be effective for application-specific workloads with known power-of-2 block sizes.
