## How does an allocator implement coalescing?

An allocator implements coalescing by referring to the block it wants to free as the current block. Coalescing the next free block (in memory) is straightforward and efficient since the header of the current block points to the header of the next block, which can be checked to determine if the next block is free. If so, its size is added to the size of the current header, and the blocks are coalesced in constant time.

## How can an allocator coalesce the previous block efficiently?

Knuth developed a technique called boundary tags, which allows for constant-time coalescing of the previous block. The idea is to add a footer (the boundary tag) at the end of each block, where the footer is a replica of the header. If each block includes such a footer, the allocator can determine the starting location and status of the previous block by inspecting its footer, which is always one word away from the start of the current block.

## What are the four cases when freeing a current block?

1.  Both the previous and next blocks are allocated.
2.  The previous block is allocated, and the next block is free.
3.  The previous block is free, and the next block is allocated.
4.  Both the previous and next blocks are free.

## How does coalescing work for each of the four cases?

1.  No coalescing is possible, so the status of the current block is changed from allocated to free.
2.  The current block is merged with the next block, updating the header of the current block and the footer of the next block with the combined sizes of the current and next blocks.
3.  The previous block is merged with the current block, updating the header of the previous block and the footer of the current block with the combined sizes of the two blocks.
4.  All three blocks are merged to form a single free block, updating the header of the previous block and the footer of the next block with the combined sizes of the three blocks.

In each case, the coalescing is performed in constant time.

## What is the potential disadvantage of using boundary tags?

The potential disadvantage of using boundary tags is the additional memory overhead introduced by requiring each block to contain both a header and a footer. This can be significant if an application manipulates many small blocks.

## How can the boundary tags technique be optimized?

A clever optimization of boundary tags eliminates the need for a footer in allocated blocks. By storing the allocated/free bit of the previous block in one of the excess low-order bits of the current block, allocated blocks wouldn't need footers, and the extra space could be used for payload. Note that free blocks would still need footers.
