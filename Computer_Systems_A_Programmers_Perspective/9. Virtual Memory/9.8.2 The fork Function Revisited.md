### What is the fork function in virtual memory?

The `fork` function is used to create a new process in the operating system. It creates a new process by creating various data structures, such as the `mm_struct`, `area structs`, and page tables, and assigning it a unique process ID (PID).

### How does the fork function create a new virtual memory space?

The `fork` function creates a new virtual memory space for the new process by making exact copies of the current process's `mm_struct`, `area structs`, and page tables. It flags each page in both processes as read-only and flags each area struct in both processes as private copy-on-write. This is to ensure that the virtual memory of each process is kept separate and isolated.

### What is the effect of copy-on-write in the fork function?

The copy-on-write mechanism ensures that when either of the processes performs any subsequent writes, new pages are created to preserve the abstraction of a private address space for each process. This means that any changes made to the virtual memory of one process will not affect the virtual memory of the other process. 


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int x = 42;
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process: x = %d\n", x);
        x = 43;
        printf("Child process: x = %d\n", x);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process: x = %d\n", x);
        x = 44;
        printf("Parent process: x = %d\n", x);
    }
    return 0;

/*
Parent process: x = 42
Parent process: x = 44
Child process: x = 42
Child process: x = 43
*/

}

```

When the `fork` system call is executed, the kernel creates a new process, which is an exact copy of the current process. This includes an exact copy of the virtual memory of the current process, including all data structures such as the `mm_struct`, `area structs`, and `page tables`. The pages of memory in both processes are flagged as read-only and the `area structs` are flagged as private copy-on-write.

As a result, when the child process runs, it has its own private copy of the virtual memory, including the value of the variable `x`. When the child process modifies the value of `x`, it triggers a copy-on-write operation, which creates a new page with the updated value of `x` in the child's virtual memory. The original page in the parent's virtual memory remains unchanged.

This demonstrates how the `fork` function creates a new process with its own private virtual address space, while preserving the abstraction of a shared address space between the parent and child processes.
