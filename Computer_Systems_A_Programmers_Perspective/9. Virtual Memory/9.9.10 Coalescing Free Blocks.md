## What happens if the allocator cannot find a suitable free block for the requested size?

If the allocator is unable to find a fit for the requested block, it has two options:

1.  Try to create larger free blocks by merging (coalescing) adjacent free blocks.
2.  Request additional heap memory from the kernel by calling the `sbrk` function.

If neither option yields a sufficiently large block, the allocator inserts the new memory into the free list and places the requested block in the new free block.

## What is false fragmentation?

False fragmentation is a phenomenon where available free memory is divided into small, unusable free blocks. This occurs when adjacent free blocks are not merged, making it difficult to allocate larger memory requests even though there is enough aggregate free memory available.

## What is coalescing?

Coalescing is the process of merging adjacent free blocks in memory. It's an important technique used by allocators to combat false fragmentation and make memory allocation more efficient.

## What are the two policy decisions for when to perform coalescing?

1.  Immediate coalescing: The allocator merges adjacent free blocks each time a block is freed.
2.  Deferred coalescing: The allocator waits to merge free blocks at a later time, such as when an allocation request fails or during a scheduled scan of the entire heap.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of immediate coalescing?

Immediate coalescing is straightforward and can be performed in constant time. However, with some request patterns, it can introduce a form of thrashing where a block is repeatedly coalesced and then split soon thereafter. This leads to unnecessary splitting and coalescing, reducing the allocator's efficiency.

## What is an example of false fragmentation?

Consider the following ASCII art representation:
```c
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| F | F | A | A | A | F | F |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
In this example, there are two free blocks (F) adjacent to an allocated block (A). A subsequent request for a larger block (e.g., four words) would fail, even though the aggregate size of the two free blocks is enough to satisfy the request. This situation illustrates false fragmentation.

## How can coalescing help in the example of false fragmentation?

In the false fragmentation example, coalescing would merge the two adjacent free blocks into a single, larger free block. This would allow the allocator to fulfill the larger request:
```c
Before coalescing:
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| F | F | A | A | A | F | F |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

After coalescing:
+-------+---+---+---+-------+
|   F   | A | A | A |   F   |
+-------+---+---+---+-------+
```
Now, a request for a four-word block can be successfully allocated, as the second free block is large enough to accommodate the request.
