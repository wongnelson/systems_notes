### What is address translation in computer systems?

Address translation is a mapping between the elements of a virtual address space (VAS) and a physical address space (PAS). The mapping allows the CPU to access data stored in physical memory using virtual addresses.

### What are the components of a virtual address (VA) and a physical address (PA)?

The components of a virtual address (VA) are:

-   Virtual page offset (VPO): a p-bit offset within a virtual page.
-   Virtual page number (VPN): an (n - p)-bit identifier for a virtual page.
```c
 +--------------------------------+
 | VA (Virtual Address)           |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Bit 31  Bit 30  ...  Bit p+1 |
 |   Bit n-p Bit n-p-1 ...  Bit p  |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Virtual Page Number (VPN)    |
 |   n - p bits                   |
 |   Bit 31  Bit 30  ...  Bit p+1 |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Virtual Page Offset (VPO)    |
 |   p bits                       |
 |   Bit p-1  Bit p-2 ...  Bit 0  |
 +--------------------------------+
```

The components of a physical address (PA) are:

-   Physical page offset (PPO): a p-bit offset within a physical page.
-   Physical page number (PPN): an (m - p)-bit identifier for a physical page.
 ```c
 +--------------------------------+
 | PA (Physical Address)          |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Bit 31  Bit 30  ...  Bit p+1 |
 |   Bit m-p Bit m-p-1 ...  Bit p  |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Physical Page Number (PPN)   |
 |   m - p bits                   |
 |   Bit 31  Bit 30  ...  Bit p+1 |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Physical Page Offset (PPO)   |
 |   p bits                       |
 |   Bit p-1  Bit p-2 ...  Bit 0  |
 +--------------------------------+
```

## Why is the VPO needed?
The virtual page offset (VPO) is needed to locate a specific byte within a virtual page in virtual memory.

In virtual memory systems, the virtual address space is divided into pages of size P, where each page is a block of contiguous memory. The virtual page offset is used to specify the location of a byte within a page.

The virtual page offset is an important component of virtual addresses as it allows the virtual memory system to map individual bytes within a page to their corresponding physical locations. This enables the virtual memory system to provide a large virtual address space, while using a smaller physical memory.

Without the virtual page offset, the virtual memory system would only be able to map entire pages to physical memory, which would result in a much less efficient use of physical memory and would make it difficult to manage the mapping of individual bytes.

The virtual page offset also enables the virtual memory system to provide fine-grained memory protection and access control, as it can be used to prevent unauthorized access to specific bytes within a page.

### Why does the least significant bits of the virtual address represent the virtual page offset
The least significant bits of the virtual address represent the virtual page offset because the virtual address space is divided into pages of a fixed size, such as 4 KB. The virtual page offset specifies the location of a byte within a virtual page, and it is specified using the least significant bits of the virtual address.

For example, suppose the virtual address space is 32 bits and the page size is 4 KB (2^12 bytes), which means that the virtual page offset would be 12 bits. In this case, the least significant 12 bits of the virtual address would represent the virtual page offset, while the most significant 20 bits would represent the virtual page number.

The reason the least significant bits are used for the virtual page offset is because the virtual address is divided into two parts: the virtual page number and the virtual page offset. The virtual page number is used to identify the virtual page, while the virtual page offset is used to specify the location of a byte within the virtual page.

The virtual page offset is represented using the least significant bits of the virtual address because these bits are used to specify the location of a byte within a virtual page. The virtual page number is represented using the most significant bits of the virtual address because these bits are used to identify the virtual page.

### Example of how the virtual page offset is used in virtual memory
Suppose we have a virtual address space of 32 bits and a physical memory of 24 bits, and the page size is 4 KB (4096 bytes). The virtual page offset would require log2(4096) = 12 bits, as there are 2^12 = 4096 possible offset values within a page. The virtual page number would require 32 - 12 = 20 bits, as it needs to identify one of 2^20 = 1048576 virtual pages.

Let's say we have a virtual address 0x00001000, which maps to the physical address 0x00300000. <font color="#2DC26B"><font color="#2DC26B">In this case, the virtual page offset would be 0x00001000 & 0x00000FFF = 0x00000, which corresponds to the first byte within the virtual page</font></font>. The virtual page number would be 0x00001000 >> 12 = 0x00000010, which would be used to look up the corresponding page table entry.

The page table entry would contain the physical page number (PPN), which in this example is 0x00300000 >> 12 = 0x00000300. To obtain the physical address, the PPN and VPO would be concatenated: 0x00000300 << 12 | 0x00000 = 0x00300000.

This example shows how the virtual page offset and virtual page number are used in virtual memory to map a virtual address to a physical address. The virtual page offset is used to locate a specific byte within a virtual page, while the virtual page number is used to identify the virtual page and look up the corresponding page table entry.

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">green</span>
The virtual page offset is obtained by applying a bitwise AND operation between the virtual address and a mask value that has 1s in the least significant bits corresponding to the size of the virtual page offset.

In the example, the virtual address 0x00001000 is ANDed with the mask value 0x00000FFF, which has 12 bits set to 1 (corresponding to the size of the virtual page offset). This operation isolates the least significant 12 bits of the virtual address, which represent the virtual page offset. The result of the AND operation is 0x00000, which corresponds to the first byte within the virtual page.

The bitwise AND operation is used to isolate the virtual page offset because it sets all the bits other than the least significant bits to 0, leaving only the virtual page offset intact. This allows the virtual memory system to determine the location of a specific byte within a virtual page based on the virtual address.

### How does the MMU use the page table to perform address translation?

The MMU uses the virtual page number (VPN) from the virtual address to select the corresponding page table entry (PTE). The physical address is constructed by concatenating the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">physical page number (PPN) from the PTE </mark>and the virtual page offset (VPO) from the virtual address.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The page table entry (PTE) </mark>contains the physical page number (PPN) as one of its fields. The PTE is a data structure that maps virtual page numbers (VPNs) to physical page numbers (PPNs), and it is used by the memory management unit (MMU) to perform address translation.

Here's an example of how a PTE might contain the PPN:
```c
 +--------------------------------+
 | PTE (Page Table Entry)         |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Valid Bit                     |
 |   1 bit                         |
 |   Bit 0                         |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Physical Page Number (PPN)   |
 |   10 bits                      |
 |   Bit 9   Bit 8  ...  Bit 0    |
 +--------------------------------+
 |   Additional Fields             |
 |   (e.g., permission bits)      |
 +--------------------------------+
```

In this example, the PTE is a 12-bit value that contains three fields:

-   The valid bit is a 1-bit field that indicates whether the PTE is valid or not. If the valid bit is set to 1, it means that the PTE is valid, and the PPN and other fields in the PTE are used by the MMU. If the valid bit is set to 0, it means that the PTE is not valid, and the MMU triggers a page fault if the virtual address that corresponds to this PTE is used.
    
-   The physical page number (PPN) is a 10-bit field that contains the physical page number that maps to the virtual page number specified by the VPN.
    
-   Additional fields can contain information such as permission bits that control access to the page, modify bits that indicate whether the page has been modified, and other information that is used by the MMU.
    

When the MMU performs address translation, it uses the virtual address and the page table to construct the corresponding physical address. The VPN is used to select the appropriate PTE, and the PPN in the PTE is concatenated with the virtual page offset (VPO) from the virtual address to form the physical address.

### What is the role of the page table base register (PTBR) in address translation?

The page table base register (PTBR) is a control register in the CPU that points to the current page table. The MMU uses the PTBR to access the page table for address translation.

### What happens during a page hit in address translation?

During a page hit, the CPU generates a virtual address and sends it to the MMU. The MMU generates the PTE address, requests it from the cache/main memory, and returns the PTE to the MMU. The MMU then constructs the physical address and sends it to the cache/main memory, which returns the requested data word to the processor.

### What happens during a page fault in address translation?

During a page fault, the valid bit in the PTE is zero, so the MMU triggers an exception, which transfers control to a page fault exception handler in the operating system kernel. The fault handler identifies a victim page in physical memory, pages it out to disk if necessary, pages in the new page, updates the PTE in memory, and returns control to the original process. The CPU resends the offending virtual address to the MMU, which now performs a page hit, returning the requested data word to the processor.

Example:
Consider a virtual address VA = 10011010101.
The virtual page offset (VPO) is the least significant p bits, which are equal to 10101.
The virtual page number (VPN) is the most significant (n - p) bits, which are equal to 10011.
Let's assume that the page size (P) is equal to 2^p bytes.
The MMU uses the VPN to select the corresponding PTE, which has a physical page number (PPN) equal to 01011.
The physical address is constructed as PA = PPN || VPO, which is equal to 010111010101.

### 9.3 

Given a 32-bit virtual address space (N = 2^32), and a 24-bit physical address space (M = 2^24), the number of bits in the VPN, VPO, PPN, and PPO can be calculated as follows:
P = 1 KB:
VPN bits = log2(N/P) = log2(2^32/1024) = log2(2^22) = 22 bits
VPO bits = log2(P) = log2(1024) = 10 bits
PPN bits = log2(M/P) = log2(2^24/1024) = log2(2^14) = 14 bits
PPO bits = VPO bits = 10 bits

P = 2 KB:
VPN bits = log2(N/P) = log2(2^32/2048) = log2(2^21) = 21 bits
VPO bits = log2(P) = log2(2048) = 11 bits
PPN bits = log2(M/P) = log2(2^24/2048) = log2(2^13) = 13 bits
PPO bits = VPO bits = 11 bits

P = 4 KB:
VPN bits = log2(N/P) = log2(2^32/4096) = log2(2^20) = 20 bits
VPO bits = log2(P) = log2(4096) = 12 bits
PPN bits = log2(M/P) = log2(2^24/4096) = log2(2^12) = 12 bits
PPO bits = VPO bits = 12 bits

P = 8 KB:
VPN bits = log2(N/P) = log2(2^32/8192) = log2(2^19) = 19 bits
VPO bits = log2(P) = log2(8192) = 13 bits
PPN bits = log2(M/P) = log2(2^24/8192) = log2(2^11) = 11 bits
PPO bits = VPO bits = 13 bits

So, the number of VPN, VPO, PPN, and PPO bits depends on the page size (P). As the page size increases, the number of VPN and PPN bits decreases, while the number of VPO and PPO bits increases.
