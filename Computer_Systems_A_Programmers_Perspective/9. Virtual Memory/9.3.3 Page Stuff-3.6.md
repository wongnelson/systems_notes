## 9.3.3 Page Hits

**Q: What happens when the CPU reads a word of virtual memory contained in VP 2?**

A: The CPU reads a word of virtual memory by utilizing the address translation hardware. This hardware uses the virtual address of the memory as an index to locate the corresponding page table entry (PTE) for that virtual page (VP). Once the PTE is located, the hardware checks the valid bit in the PTE to determine if the virtual page is cached in the main memory (DRAM). If the valid bit is set, it means that the VP is indeed cached in memory. The hardware then uses the physical memory address stored in the PTE, which points to the start of the cached page in physical memory (PP), to construct the physical address of the word and access it.

It's important to understand the concept of page hits because they allow the CPU to access the virtual memory in a faster and more efficient manner. When a page hit occurs, the CPU can access the virtual memory without having to go through the time-consuming process of fetching the page from disk.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of page hits:
```c
Consider a computer system with virtual memory that has virtual page 2 stored in physical page 1. When the CPU wants to access a word of virtual memory contained in VP 2, it sends the virtual address of the memory to the address translation hardware. The hardware uses the virtual address to locate PTE 2 in the page table. When PTE 2 is found, the hardware checks the valid bit and sees that it is set, indicating that VP 2 is cached in DRAM. The hardware then uses the physical memory address in PTE 2, which points to the start of the cached page in PP 1, to construct the physical address of the word and access it.

The reference to a word in VP 2 is a hit.

## 9.3.4 Page Faults

### What is a page fault in virtual memory?

A page fault in virtual memory occurs when the CPU references a virtual page (VP) that is not currently stored in the main memory (DRAM). This happens when the valid bit in the corresponding page table entry (PTE) for the VP is set to 0, indicating that the VP is not cached in memory.

### What happens when a page fault occurs?

When a page fault occurs, the address translation hardware raises a page fault exception. This exception triggers the execution of a page fault handler in the operating system's kernel. The page fault handler is responsible for managing the situation and resolving the page fault.

### What does the page fault handler do?

The page fault handler has several tasks to perform. First, it selects a victim page from memory that will be evicted if necessary to make space for the required page. If the victim page needs to be written back to disk, it is swapped out.

Next, the page fault handler fetches the required page from disk and brings it into the main memory. It updates the page table entry for the virtual page to indicate that it is now cached in memory, setting the valid bit to 1.

Finally, the page fault handler restarts the faulting instruction, allowing the CPU to continue its execution with the newly loaded page in the main memory.

### Why are page faults important in virtual memory?

Page faults play a crucial role in managing the limited size of the main memory and providing the illusion of a large, unlimited memory to the CPU. When the main memory becomes full and a page fault occurs, the page fault handler selects a <span style="background:rgba(160, 204, 246, 0.55)">victim page </span>to swap out to disk, creating space for the new page to be brought into memory. This swapping mechanism allows the system to efficiently manage memory resources and ensure that the most relevant data is present in the main memory for faster access by the CPU.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">blue</mark>
A victim page in virtual memory refers to a page in the main memory that is selected by the page fault handler to be swapped out to disk in order to make room for a page that is needed by the CPU but is not currently cached in memory.
Here's an example to illustrate the concept of page faults:
```c
Consider a computer system with virtual memory that has virtual page 3 not stored in physical memory. When the CPU wants to access a word of virtual memory contained in VP 3, it sends the virtual address of the memory to the address translation hardware. The hardware uses the virtual address to locate PTE 3 in the page table. When PTE 3 is found, the hardware checks the valid bit and sees that it is set to 0, indicating that VP 3 is not cached in DRAM. The hardware then raises a page fault exception, triggering the execution of the page fault handler in the kernel.

Figure 9.6 VM page fault (before).
The reference to a word in VP 3 is a miss and triggers a page fault.

**Q: Can you provide more details on the process of a page fault in virtual memory?**

A:  When a page fault occurs, the following steps take place:

1.  The address translation hardware raises a page fault exception, triggering the execution of the page fault handler in the operating system's kernel.
2.  The page fault handler selects a victim page from memory to be swapped out to disk if necessary. If the victim page has been modified, the handler copies it back to disk before swapping it out.
3.  The handler updates the page table entry for the victim page to reflect that it is no longer cached in memory.
4.  The handler fetches the required page from disk and brings it into memory.
5.  The handler updates the page table entry for the required page to reflect that it is now cached in memory.
6.  The handler restarts the faulting instruction, allowing the CPU to access the required memory without generating another page fault.

It's important to understand the process of a page fault because it allows the virtual memory system to manage the limited size of the main memory and provide the illusion of a large, unlimited memory to the CPU. The page fault handler is responsible for ensuring that the required memory is brought into memory and cached in a timely manner, so that the CPU can access it without any delays.

## 9.3.5 Allocating a New Virtual Page

### What happens when a new virtual page is needed?

When a new virtual page is needed, the operating system's kernel allocates a new page on disk. It updates the corresponding page table entry (PTE) for the virtual page to point to this newly allocated location on disk. At this stage, the new page is not yet brought into the main memory.

### When is the new virtual page brought into memory?

The new virtual page is brought into memory and cached only when it is actually referenced by the CPU. This means that when the CPU attempts to access the contents of the virtual page, a page fault occurs because the page is not currently cached in the main memory.

### What happens during a page fault for a new virtual page?

During a page fault, the page fault handler in the operating system's kernel is invoked. The handler is responsible for handling the page fault by bringing the required page into the main memory.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of allocating a new virtual page:
```c
Consider a computer system with virtual memory that needs to allocate a new virtual page 5. The kernel allocates a new page on disk and updates PTE 5 in the page table to point to this new location. The new page is only brought into memory and cached when it is actually referenced by the CPU, at which point a page fault will occur and the page fault handler will bring the page into memory.

Figure 9.8 Allocating a new virtual page.
The kernel allocates VP 5 on disk and points PTE 5 to this new location.

## 9.3.6 Locality to the Rescue Again

**Q: What is the main reason for the efficiency of virtual memory?**

A: The efficiency of virtual memory is mainly due to the principle of locality, which states that at any point in time, programs will tend to work on a smaller set of active pages known as the working set or resident set. This means that after an initial overhead where the working set is paged into memory, subsequent references to the working set result in page hits and there is no additional disk traffic.

**Q: What is the working set or resident set in virtual memory?**

A: The working set or resident set in virtual memory refers to the set of active pages that a program is currently working on. These pages are stored in the main memory and are being referenced frequently. The principle of locality states that at any point in time, programs will tend to work on a smaller set of active pages, which makes virtual memory efficient.

**Q: What is thrashing in virtual memory?**

A: Thrashing in virtual memory occurs when the working set size of a program exceeds the size of the physical memory. In this situation, pages are swapped in and out continuously, leading to a situation where the program's performance slows to a crawl. Thrashing is an indication that the program is not exhibiting good temporal locality and is not effectively using the virtual memory system.

**Q: Can you provide more information on how virtual memory provides separate address spaces for different processes?**

A: Yes! The operating system maintains a separate page table for each process in the system. This allows each process to have its own virtual address space, with its own set of virtual pages and corresponding physical pages in memory. Figure 9.9 illustrates how virtual memory provides separate address spaces for different processes.
```c

The operating system maintains a separate page table for each process in the system.
