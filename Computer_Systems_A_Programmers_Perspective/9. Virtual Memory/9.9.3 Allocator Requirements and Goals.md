## What are the requirements for allocators?

Allocators must operate within certain constraints and strive to meet the goals of maximizing throughput and memory utilization. The constraints for allocators include:

-   Handling arbitrary request sequences: Allocate and free requests can be made in any order, and the allocator cannot assume any specific ordering of these requests.
-   Making immediate responses to requests: The allocator must respond immediately to allocate requests and cannot reorder or buffer requests.
-   Using only the heap: Any data structures used by the allocator must be stored in the heap.
-   Aligning blocks: The allocator must align blocks in such a way that they can hold any type of data object.
-   Not modifying allocated blocks: Allocators can only manipulate free blocks and cannot modify or move allocated blocks.

## What is the goal of maximizing throughput?

The goal of maximizing throughput is to complete as many allocate and free requests as possible per unit of time. This is achieved by minimizing the average time to satisfy allocate and free requests. An allocator with good performance should have a worst-case running time of an allocate request that is linear in the number of free blocks and a running time of a free request that is constant.

## What is the goal of maximizing memory utilization?

The goal of maximizing memory utilization is to use virtual memory efficiently as it is a finite resource. The most useful metric for measuring how efficiently an allocator uses the heap is peak utilization, which is defined as the maximum ratio of the aggregate payload (sum of payloads of currently allocated blocks) to the size of the heap over a sequence of allocate and free requests. The objective of the allocator is to maximize the peak utilization over the entire sequence of requests.

## What is the tension between maximizing throughput and memory utilization?

There is a tension between maximizing throughput and memory utilization as it is easy to write an allocator that maximizes throughput at the expense of heap utilization. Finding a balance between the two goals is one of the challenges in allocator design.
