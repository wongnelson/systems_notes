## What is an implicit free list and why is it not appropriate for general-purpose allocators?

An implicit free list is a simple method to organize free blocks in a memory allocator by using the size field in the block headers to navigate the free blocks. This approach is not appropriate for general-purpose allocators because block allocation time is linear in the total number of heap blocks, which can be inefficient for large heaps or heaps with many blocks.

## How can we improve the organization of free blocks compared to an implicit free list?

A better approach to organize free blocks is to use an explicit data structure. Since the body of a free block is not needed by the program, the pointers that implement the data structure can be stored within the bodies of the free blocks. For example, a doubly linked free list can be used by including predecessor and successor pointers in each free block.

## How does using a doubly linked list improve block allocation time?

Using a doubly linked list instead of an implicit free list reduces the first-fit allocation time from linear in the total number of blocks to linear in the number of free blocks. This improvement results in faster allocation time, especially when there are many more allocated blocks than free blocks.

Imagine we have a heap with 10 blocks in total, 4 of which are free blocks, as shown below:
```ruby
Heap: [A1] [F1] [A2] [F2] [A3] [A4] [F3] [A5] [F4] [A6]
```
`A` denotes allocated blocks, and `F` denotes free blocks. Numbers denote the order of the blocks in the heap.

### Implicit Free List

With an implicit free list, the allocator has to traverse the entire heap to find a free block. In the worst case, it may have to traverse all 10 blocks in our example to find a suitable free block. The allocation time complexity is linear in the total number of heap blocks (O(total_blocks)).

### Doubly Linked Free List

With a doubly linked free list, the allocator maintains a separate list connecting only the free blocks, as shown below:

```ruby
Free List: [F1] <-> [F2] <-> [F3] <-> [F4]
```

Now, when searching for a free block, the allocator only has to traverse the free blocks in the free list, not the entire heap. In our example, it only needs to traverse at most 4 blocks, which is faster than traversing all 10 blocks in the heap. The allocation time complexity is linear in the number of free blocks (O(free_blocks)).

In this example, using a doubly linked free list reduces the first-fit allocation time from linear in the total number of blocks (10) to linear in the number of free blocks (4), resulting in faster allocation time. This improvement becomes even more significant when there are many more allocated blocks than free blocks in the heap.

## What are the trade-offs between maintaining a LIFO-ordered free list and an address-ordered free list?

Consider a scenario where we have 4 blocks of memory, with blocks 1 and 3 being allocated and blocks 2 and 4 being free.

With a LIFO-ordered free list, the free blocks are stored in the order in which they were freed, with the most recently freed block being stored first. Here's what the LIFO-ordered free list might look like:

`Block 4 (free) <--> Block 2 (free)`

With an address-ordered free list, the free blocks are stored in order based on their memory addresses. Here's what the address-ordered free list might look like:

`Block 2 (free) <--> Block 4 (free)`

When allocating memory, the first-fit placement policy requires the allocator to inspect the blocks in the order in which they appear in the free list.

With a LIFO-ordered free list, the allocator would inspect the most recently freed blocks first. In this case, the allocator would inspect Block 4 and determine that it is not large enough to fit the allocation request. The allocator would then inspect Block 2 and determine that it is large enough to fit the allocation request, so it would be allocated.

With an address-ordered free list, the allocator would inspect the blocks in order based on their memory addresses. In this case, the allocator would inspect Block 2 and determine that it is large enough to fit the allocation request, so it would be allocated.

In terms of performance, freeing a block and coalescing with boundary tags can be performed in constant time with a LIFO-ordered free list. However, LIFO-ordered first fit may have worse memory utilization than address-ordered first fit. On the other hand, address-ordered first fit requires a linear-time search to locate the appropriate predecessor when freeing a block, but it enjoys better memory utilization than LIFO-ordered first fit, approaching the utilization of best fit.

It's important to note that the choice between a LIFO-ordered free list and an address-ordered free list depends on the specific requirements of the memory allocator and the trade-offs between performance and memory utilization that are acceptable for a given use case.

## What is a disadvantage of explicit lists in memory allocators?

A disadvantage of explicit lists is that free blocks must be large enough to contain all of the necessary pointers (predecessor and successor), as well as the header and possibly a footer. This requirement results in a larger minimum block size and increases the potential for internal fragmentation.
