## What is the cause of poor heap utilization?

Poor heap utilization is caused by fragmentation, which occurs when otherwise unused memory is not available to satisfy allocate requests.

## What are the two forms of fragmentation?

The two forms of fragmentation are:

### Internal fragmentation

Internal fragmentation occurs when an allocated block is larger than the payload. This can happen due to the implementation of an allocator imposing a minimum size on allocated blocks that is greater than the requested payload, or due to the allocator increasing the block size to satisfy alignment constraints.

Internal fragmentation is straightforward to quantify and depends only on the pattern of previous requests and the allocator implementation.

An example, suppose an allocator has implemented a minimum block size of 16 bytes. If a program requests 8 bytes of memory, the allocator will allocate a block of 16 bytes (8 bytes for the payload and 8 bytes of internal fragmentation). The amount of internal fragmentation in this case would be 8 bytes.

### External fragmentation

External fragmentation occurs when there is enough aggregate free memory to satisfy an allocate request, but no single free block is large enough to handle the request. This happens when free memory is spread over multiple free blocks.

External fragmentation is more difficult to quantify as it depends on the pattern of previous and future requests, as well as the allocator implementation.

Here's an example to illustrate external fragmentation:

Let's say we have a system with a total memory size of 100 KB and an allocator that uses fixed-size blocks of 10 KB each. Initially, the entire memory is free, and the allocator divides the memory into ten 10 KB blocks.

Now suppose the following sequence of memory allocation and deallocation requests occur:

1.  Allocate a 20 KB block
2.  Allocate a 10 KB block
3.  Allocate a 30 KB block
4.  Deallocate the 20 KB block
5.  Allocate a 10 KB block

At this point, we have 40 KB of free memory (two 10 KB blocks and one 20 KB block). However, if another request comes in for a 25 KB block, we cannot satisfy it because there is no single free block that is large enough to accommodate it. In this case, we have external fragmentation because the aggregate free memory is enough to satisfy the request, but the free memory is spread over multiple non-contiguous blocks.

## How do allocators handle external fragmentation?

Since external fragmentation is difficult to quantify and predict, allocators typically employ heuristics that attempt to maintain small numbers of larger free blocks rather than large numbers of smaller free blocks. This helps reduce the likelihood of external fragmentation and improves heap utilization.
