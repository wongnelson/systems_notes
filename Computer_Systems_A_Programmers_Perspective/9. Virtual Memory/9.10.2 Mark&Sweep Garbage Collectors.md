## What is the Mark&Sweep Garbage Collector?

The Mark&Sweep Garbage Collector is a garbage collection algorithm that consists of two phases: the mark phase, which marks all reachable and allocated descendants of the root nodes, and the sweep phase, which frees each unmarked allocated block. This approach allows the garbage collector to identify and reclaim unreachable memory blocks.

## How does the Mark phase of the Mark&Sweep Garbage Collector work?

The mark phase of the Mark&Sweep Garbage Collector works by calling the `mark` function for each root node. The `mark` function does the following:

1.  Checks if the pointer points to a valid allocated block.
2.  If the block is already marked, the function returns.
3.  If the block is not marked, the function marks the block.
4.  The function then calls itself recursively on each word in the block.

By the end of the mark phase, any allocated block that is not marked is guaranteed to be unreachable and can be reclaimed in the sweep phase.

## How does the Sweep phase of the Mark&Sweep Garbage Collector work?

The sweep phase of the Mark&Sweep Garbage Collector is a single call to the `sweep` function. This function iterates over each block in the heap, freeing any unmarked allocated blocks (garbage) that it encounters.

## Can you provide a simple example of Mark&Sweep in action?

Consider the following example:
```
Root Nodes: R1

Heap Nodes: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6

          R1
           |
          H1
         /   \
       H2     H3
             /   \
           H4     H5
```

1.  Root node R1 points to H1.
2.  H1 points to H2 and H3.
3.  H3 points to H4 and H5.

The Mark phase would mark H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 as reachable. The Sweep phase would then leave those blocks untouched. If there were any unmarked blocks, such as H6, they would be freed and returned to the free list.

### Does the reachability graph have to be constructed independently of the heap?

The reachability graph does not have to be constructed independently of the heap, but it can be helpful to have a separate representation of the reachability graph in order to simplify the garbage collection process.

In most garbage collection algorithms, the reachability graph is constructed as the program is executing, and the garbage collector uses the reachability graph to determine which objects are still in use and which objects are no longer needed. The reachability graph is typically constructed by following pointers from the roots to other objects in the heap.

Having a separate representation of the reachability graph can simplify the garbage collection process because it provides a clear and concise view of the objects in the heap and how they are related. This can make it easier to determine which objects are reachable and which objects are unreachable, and can also make it easier to implement other garbage collection algorithms, such as compacting collectors or incremental collectors.
