## What is the simplest imaginable allocator?

The simplest imaginable allocator is an extreme point in the design space and would organize the heap as a large array of bytes and a pointer `p` that initially points to the first byte of the array. To allocate `size` bytes, `malloc` would save the current value of `p` on the stack, increment `p` by `size`, and return the old value of `p` to the caller. Free would simply return to the caller without doing anything.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

static char *heap_ptr = NULL;

void *malloc(size_t size) {
    void *block = NULL;

    if (size > 0) {
        if (heap_ptr == NULL) {
            /* Initialize heap on first allocation */
            heap_ptr = (char *)sbrk(0);
        }

        block = (void *)heap_ptr;
        heap_ptr += size;
    }

    return block;
}

void free(void *block) {
    /* no-op */
}
```
In this example, the `malloc` function simply increments the `heap_ptr` by `size` to allocate memory and returns the old value of `heap_ptr` as the allocated block. The `free` function does nothing, as there is no need to track or manage memory in this simple allocator.

## What are the limitations of the simplest allocator?

This naive allocator has extremely good throughput since each `malloc` and `free` execute only a handful of instructions. However, since the allocator never reuses any blocks, memory utilization would be extremely bad.

## What are the important issues to consider while designing a practical allocator?

A practical allocator that strikes a better balance between throughput and utilization must consider the following issues:

1.  Free block organization: How do we keep track of free blocks?
2.  Placement: How do we choose an appropriate free block in which to place a newly allocated block?
3.  Splitting: After we place a newly allocated block in some free block, what do we do with the remainder of the free block?
4.  Coalescing: What do we do with a block that has just been freed?

The rest of this section looks at these issues in more detail. Since the basic techniques of placement, splitting, and coalescing cut across many different free block organizations, we will introduce them in the context of a simple free block organization known as an implicit free list.
