## Introduction to Segregated Free Lists

Segregated free lists is a memory allocation technique that organizes free blocks of memory by size, grouping blocks of similar sizes into separate linked lists. This technique is used in many modern memory allocators, such as the one used in the GNU C Library.

The segregated free list technique can help reduce fragmentation and improve the efficiency of memory allocation and deallocation, especially in scenarios where memory requests tend to be of similar sizes.

## Implementation of Segregated Free Lists in Python

To implement segregated free lists in Python, we can define a `SegregatedFreeListAllocator` class that maintains separate linked lists of free blocks of different sizes. When a memory allocation request is made, the allocator searches the linked list for a block of the appropriate size. If a suitable block is found, it is removed from the list and returned to the requesting program. If no suitable block is found, the allocator requests more memory from the operating system and adds it to the appropriate linked list.

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, size, next_block=None):
        self.size = size
        self.next_block = next_block

class SegregatedFreeListAllocator:
    def __init__(self, block_size, num_classes):
        self.block_size = block_size
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.free_lists = [None] * num_classes

    def malloc(self, size):
        # Determine the index of the linked list that corresponds to the requested size.
        class_index = self.get_class_index(size)

        # Search the linked list for a free block that is large enough to satisfy the request.
        block = self.find_block(class_index)

        # If no suitable block is found, request a new block of memory from the operating system
        # and add it to the appropriate linked list.
        if block is None:
            block = self.get_new_block(class_index)

        # Return the block to the requesting program.
        return block

    def free(self, block):
        # Determine the index of the linked list that corresponds to the size of the block.
        class_index = self.get_class_index(block.size)

        # Add the block to the appropriate linked list.
        self.add_block_to_list(block, class_index)

    def get_class_index(self, size):
        # Determine the index of the linked list that corresponds to the requested size.
        # This can be done using a formula that takes into account the block size and the number of classes.
        class_index = int(math.log2(size / self.block_size))
        class_index = min(class_index, self.num_classes - 1)
        return class_index

    def find_block(self, class_index):
        # Search the linked list for a free block that is large enough to satisfy the request.
        block = self.free_lists[class_index]
        prev_block = None

        while block is not None:
            if block.size >= self.block_size * (class_index + 1):
                # Remove the block from the linked list.
                if prev_block is None:
                    self.free_lists[class_index] = block.next_block
                else:
                    prev_block.next_block = block.next_block
                return block

            prev_block = block
            block = block.next_block

        return None

    def get_new_block(self, class_index):
        # Request a new block of memory from the operating system and add it to the appropriate linked list.
        size = self.block_size * (class_index + 1)
        block = Block(size, None)

        # Add the block to the appropriate linked list.
        self.add_block_to_list(block, class_index)

        return block

    def add_block_to_list(self, block, class_index):
        # Add a block to the appropriate linked list.
        block.next_block = self.free_lists[class_index]
        self.free_lists[class_index] = block
```
In this implementation, we define a `Block` class that represents a single block of memory. Each block has a size and a reference to the next block in the linked list.

The `SegregatedFreeListAllocator` class has a constructor that takes the size of each memory block and the number of different size classes as parameters. It also has `malloc()` and `free()` methods that are used to allocate and deallocate memory, respectively.

The `get_class_index()` method determines the index of the linked list that corresponds to the requested size. This is done using a formula that takes into account the block size and the number of classes.

The `find_block()` method searches the linked list for a free block that is large enough to satisfy the request. It starts at the head of the linked list for the appropriate size class and iterates through the blocks until a suitable block is found. If a suitable block is found, it is removed from the linked list and returned to the requesting program. If no suitable block is found, the method returns `None`.

The `get_new_block()` method requests a new block of memory from the operating system and adds it to the appropriate linked list. It calculates the size of the new block based on the requested size class and creates a new `Block` object with the appropriate size. It then adds the block to the appropriate linked list using the `add_block_to_list()` method.

The `add_block_to_list()` method adds a block to the appropriate linked list. It sets the `next_block` reference of the new block to the current head of the linked list for the appropriate size class, and then sets the head of the linked list to the new block.

## Example Usage of Segregated Free Lists

Here's an example of how to use the `SegregatedFreeListAllocator` class to allocate and deallocate memory:
```python
allocator = SegregatedFreeListAllocator(64, 8)
ptr = allocator.malloc(128)
allocator.free(ptr)
```
In this example, we create a `SegregatedFreeListAllocator` object with a block size of 64 bytes and 8 different size classes. We then allocate a block of 128 bytes using the `malloc()` method and free it using the `free()` method.
