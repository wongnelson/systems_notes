## What is dynamic memory allocation?

Dynamic memory allocation is a technique in which a program can request memory from the operating system at runtime as needed, rather than being limited by the amount of memory defined at compile time.

## What is the heap and its purpose in dynamic memory allocation?

The heap is an area of a process's virtual memory that is maintained by a dynamic memory allocator. The purpose of the heap is to provide a region of memory where the application can allocate blocks of memory at runtime as needed. The kernel maintains a variable called "brk" that points to the top of the heap.

## What are blocks in the heap and how are they used by the memory allocator?

In the heap, the memory allocator maintains blocks of virtual memory that are either allocated or free. An allocated block has been reserved for use by the application, while a free block is available for allocation. An allocated block remains allocated until it is freed, either explicitly by the application or implicitly by the memory allocator.

## What are the two basic styles of memory allocators?

The two basic styles of memory allocators are explicit allocators and implicit allocators.

## What are explicit allocators and how do they work?

Explicit allocators are memory allocators that require the application to explicitly free any allocated blocks. For example, the C standard library provides an explicit allocator called the "malloc" package. Applications allocate a block by calling the "malloc" function and free a block by calling the "free" function.

## What are implicit allocators and how do they work?

Implicit allocators, also known as garbage collectors, require the allocator to detect when an allocated block is no longer being used by the program and then free the block. This process of automatically freeing unused allocated blocks is called "garbage collection". Higher-level languages such as Lisp, ML, and Java rely on garbage collection to free allocated blocks.
