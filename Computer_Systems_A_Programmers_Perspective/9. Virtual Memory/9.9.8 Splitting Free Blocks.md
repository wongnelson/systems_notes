## How does an allocator locate a free block for allocation?

An allocator searches through the memory to find a free block that can fit the requested size. The allocator then makes a policy decision about how much of the free block to allocate.

## What are the two options when allocating a free block?

1.  Allocate the entire free block: This option is simple and fast, but it introduces internal fragmentation.
2.  Split the free block: The allocator divides the free block into two parts. The first part is allocated, and the remainder becomes a new free block. This option reduces internal fragmentation.

## What is internal fragmentation?

Internal fragmentation refers to the wasted memory space within an allocated block that cannot be used by the application. It occurs when the allocated block is larger than the requested size, resulting in unused memory within the block.

## Why is internal fragmentation important?

Internal fragmentation is important because it leads to inefficient memory usage. When memory is allocated in larger blocks than needed, it results in wasted space and reduces the overall available memory for other allocations. Allocators try to minimize internal fragmentation to ensure optimal memory usage.

## When might an allocator accept additional internal fragmentation?

If the allocator's placement policy tends to produce good fits (meaning allocated blocks are close to the requested size), then some additional internal fragmentation might be acceptable. This trade-off is made in favor of simplicity and speed.

## How does splitting a free block work?

When splitting a free block, the allocator divides the free block into two parts. The first part becomes the allocated block, sized according to the application's request, and the remainder becomes a new free block. This process reduces internal fragmentation by allocating only the required size.

For example, consider an application requesting three words of heap memory, and the allocator finds an eight-word free block. The allocator splits the eight-word block into a three-word allocated block and a five-word free block, as shown in Figure 9.37.
