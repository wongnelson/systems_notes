### What is an address space?

An address space is an ordered set of nonnegative integer addresses that can be used to access data objects in a computer system. It makes a distinction between data objects (bytes) and their attributes (addresses).

### What is a linear address space?

A linear address space is an address space where the integers are consecutive. This type of address space is simpler to discuss and will be assumed in our discussions.

### What is a virtual address space?

In a system with virtual memory, the CPU generates virtual addresses from a virtual address space of N = 2^n addresses. The size of the virtual address space is characterized by the number of bits needed to represent the largest address. Modern systems typically support either 32-bit or 64-bit virtual address spaces.

### What is a physical address space?

A physical address space corresponds to the M bytes of physical memory in the system. The size of the physical address space is also characterized by the number of bits needed to represent the largest address. For simplification, we will assume that M = 2^m.

### How is virtual memory related to address space?

Virtual memory allows each data object to have multiple independent addresses, each chosen from a different address space. Each byte of main memory has a virtual address chosen from the virtual address space and a physical address chosen from the physical address space. This allows the operating system to create the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space for each process, even if the physical memory is fragmented or sparse.

### Why is the concept of an address space important?

The concept of an address space is important because it makes a clean distinction between data objects (bytes) and their addresses (attributes). This distinction allows for better memory management and protection, and enables the use of virtual memory.
