## What is garbage collection?

Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming heap storage by freeing allocated blocks that are no longer needed by a program. These unneeded blocks are known as garbage. In systems that support garbage collection, applications explicitly allocate heap blocks but never explicitly free them. Instead, a garbage collector periodically identifies garbage blocks and frees them.

## Why is garbage collection important?

Garbage collection is important because it helps avoid common programming errors, such as failing to free allocated blocks that are no longer needed by the program. This can lead to memory leaks and inefficient use of heap space. Garbage collection is an essential feature in modern programming languages like Java, ML, Perl, and Mathematica, and it remains an active research area.

## What is an example of a programming error that can be avoided using garbage collection?

Consider the following C function that allocates a block of temporary storage:
```c
void garbage()
{
    int *p = (int *)Malloc(15213);

    return; /* Array p is garbage at this point */
}
```
In this example, the programmer has forgotten to free the block allocated to `p` before the function `garbage` returns. As a result, the allocated block remains in heap space for the lifetime of the program, needlessly occupying space that could be used for other allocations. Garbage collection can automatically identify and free such blocks, preventing memory leaks.

## What is the Mark&Sweep algorithm?

The Mark&Sweep algorithm is an early garbage collection method and it can be built on top of an existing `malloc` package to provide garbage collection for C and C++ programs. The algorithm consists of two phases:

1.  **Mark**: In this phase, the garbage collector traverses the heap and marks all reachable (non-garbage) blocks.
2.  **Sweep**: In this phase, the garbage collector scans the heap and frees unmarked (garbage) blocks, placing them back on the free list.

The Mark&Sweep algorithm is interesting because it demonstrates how garbage collection can be implemented on top of an existing memory allocation system. There are many other garbage collection algorithms in the literature, each with its own trade-offs and performance characteristics.
