## How does the execve function work in loading and executing programs?

The execve function is used to load and run a program contained in an executable object file. The following steps occur when the execve function is called:

### Step 1: Delete existing user areas

## What happens when the execve function is called?

The execve function is called to replace the current program with a new program specified in the function call.

## What is an area struct?

An area struct is a data structure that defines a region of virtual memory and how it is mapped to physical memory.

## What is the purpose of deleting the existing area structs in the user portion of the current process's virtual address?

Deleting the existing area structs in the user portion of the current process's virtual address is necessary because the new program may have different memory requirements than the current program, and the existing area structs may not be suitable for mapping the virtual memory for the new program. By deleting the existing area structs, the execve function effectively frees up the virtual memory used by the current program and makes it available for the new program to use.


### Step 2: Map private areas

New area structs are created for the code, data, bss, and stack areas of the new program. These new areas are private copy-on-write. The code and data areas are mapped to the .text and .data sections of the executable object file, while the bss area is demand-zero and mapped to an anonymous file whose size is contained in the executable object file. The stack and heap area are also demand-zero and initially of zero length.

### Step 3: Map shared areas

If the program was linked with shared objects, such as the standard C library libc.so, then these objects are dynamically linked into the program and mapped into the shared region of the user's virtual address space.

### Step 4: Set the program counter (PC)

The last step is to set the program counter in the current process's context to point to the entry point in the code area. The next time the process is scheduled, it will begin execution from the entry point, and Linux will swap in code and data pages as needed.
