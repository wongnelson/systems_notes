## Example
The first fit placement policy is a common algorithm used for packing items into containers or bins. The basic idea is to place each item in the first bin that has enough remaining capacity to accommodate it.

Here's an example implementation of the first fit placement policy in Python:
```python
class FirstFitPlacementPolicy:
    def __init__(self, max_capacity):
        self.max_capacity = max_capacity
        self.bins = []

    def place_item(self, item):
        for bin in self.bins:
            if bin.can_fit(item):
                bin.add_item(item)
                return
        new_bin = Bin(self.max_capacity)
        new_bin.add_item(item)
        self.bins.append(new_bin)
```

This implementation assumes the existence of a `Bin` class that has the following methods:

-   `can_fit(item)` returns `True` if the bin has enough capacity to accommodate the item, and `False` otherwise.
-   `add_item(item)` adds the item to the bin's contents.

The `FirstFitPlacementPolicy` class maintains a list of bins (`self.bins`) and iterates through them to find the first bin that can accommodate the item. If no such bin exists, it creates a new bin and adds it to the list.

## Bin Class Implementation

Here's an example implementation of the `Bin` class with the `can_fit()` and `add_item()` methods:

```c
class Bin:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.items = []

    def can_fit(self, item):
        return sum(item.size for item in self.items) + item.size <= self.capacity

    def add_item(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
```

In this implementation, the `Bin` class has a `capacity` attribute that represents the maximum amount of space the bin can hold, and an `items` attribute that holds the items currently in the bin.

The `can_fit()` method takes an `item` as input and returns `True` if the item can be added to the bin without exceeding its capacity, and `False` otherwise. It does this by summing the sizes of all the items currently in the bin and adding the size of the new item, and checking if the result is less than or equal to the bin's capacity.

The `add_item()` method takes an `item` as input and adds it to the `items` attribute of the bin. Note that this implementation does not check if the item can fit in the bin; that responsibility is delegated to the `can_fit()` method. In a production-level system, additional checks and error handling may be necessary.

Here's an example of how to use the `FirstFitPlacementPolicy` class to pack items into bins:
```python
policy = FirstFitPlacementPolicy(10)
items = [Item(2), Item(4), Item(6), Item(3), Item(5)]

for item in items:
    policy.place_item(item)

print(len(policy.bins))  # Output: 3
```
In this example, we create a `FirstFitPlacementPolicy` object with a maximum bin capacity of 10, and a list of five `Item` objects with various sizes. We then iterate over the items and place each one in the first bin that can accommodate it. Finally, we print the number of bins that were used to pack all the items.
