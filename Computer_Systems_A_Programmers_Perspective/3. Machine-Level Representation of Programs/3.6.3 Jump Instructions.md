q; what can a jmp inst do?
a; cause to program to go to a new position - usually to a label

q; what's a direct vs indirect jump?
a:  direct - to a location that is encoded as part of the inst. indirect - the jmp target is read from a register or memory location

#### Explain  jmp *%rax vs jmp \* (%rax)

jmp *%rax:

Imagine that the value stored in %rax is 0x400000, the instruction jmp *%rax would jump to the memory location 0x400000 and execute the instruction present at that memory location.

Here is an example of the jmp *(%rax) instruction step-by-step:

1.  The instruction jmp *(%rax) is encountered in the code.
2.  The value stored in the %rax register is 0x602000.
3.  The instruction reads the value present at memory location 0x602000. Let's assume that the value at that memory location is 0x400000.
4.  The instruction uses the value read from memory (0x400000) as the jump target.
5.  The instruction jumps to the memory location 0x400000 and starts executing the instruction present at that memory location.

So, in this example, the instruction jmp *(%rax) is reading a memory location, using the content of that memory location as the jump target, and then jumping to that location to execute the instruction present at that memory location.
