The unary operators `&' and` *' in C allow the generation and dereferencing of pointers.

The operator `&' (address-of operator) returns the memory address of its operand. For example, given an integer variable` a`, the expression &a will return the memory address of` a`.

On the other hand, the operator `*' (dereference operator) returns the value stored at a memory address. For example, given a pointer` ptr`that points to an integer variable, the expression *ptr will return the value stored in the memory location to which`ptr` points.

In the expression &Expr the `&` operator returns the memory address of the object that Expr denotes. And in the expression *&Expr, the `*` operator dereferences the memory address returned by `&Expr` and retrieves the value of the object. Therefore, Expr and *&Expr are equivalent, which means they both return the same value.

Here's an example to illustrate this point:
```c
int a = 5;
int* ptr = &a;

printf("a = %d\n", a); // prints 5
printf("&a = %p\n", &a); // prints the memory address of a
printf("*&a = %d\n", *&a); // prints 5
printf("ptr = %p\n", ptr); // prints the memory address of a
printf("*ptr = %d\n", *ptr); // prints 5
```
As you can see the values of a and *&a are the same, the value of ptr and &a are the same and the value of *ptr and a are the same.

The `&` operator is used to retrieve the memory address of an object and the `*` operator is used to retrieve the value stored at a memory address. By combining these two operators, we can generate and dereference pointers, allowing us to access data stored in different memory locations.

#### 3.37
Suppose x`S`, the address of short integer array `S`, and long integer index i are stored in registers `%rdx` and `%rcx`, respectively. For each of the following expressions, give its type, a formula for its value, and an assembly-code implementation. The result should be stored in register `%rax` if it is a pointer and register element `%ax` if it has data type short.

q; why is S+1 type short \*?
a; because it refers to the memory address of the element that follows the first element of the array S. Since S is an array of short integers, each element in the array occupies 2 bytes of memory, adding 1 to the starting address of the array S will give the address of the second element of the array. This address is a memory address, represented by a pointer, so the type of S+1 is short *

q: why is the type short * for &s[i]?
a: when you use the '&' operator to take the address of an array element, it returns a pointer to the memory location of that element. This pointer points to the type of the element. For example, if you have an array of integers, int A[10], and you take the address of the first element A[0] by using &A[0], the resulting pointer will be of type "pointer to int" because it points to the memory location of an int type element. Similarly, if you have an array of short integers, short S[10], and you take the address of the first element S[0] by using &S[0], the resulting pointer will be of type "pointer to short" because it points to the memory location of a short type element. In the case of &S[i], the pointer type is "short *" as it is pointing to the memory location of i-th element of array S which is a short type element.
