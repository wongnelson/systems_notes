## **Just read the chapter** 

q; why do many computer systems place restrictions on the allowable addresses for primitive data types, requiring that the address for some objects must be a multiple of some value K (typically 2, 4, or 8)?
a; Such _alignment restrictions_ simplify the design of the hardware forming the interface between the processor and the memory system

q; what's an example of ^?
a; For example, suppose a processor always fetches 8 bytes from memory with an address that must be a multiple of 8. If we can guarantee that any double will be aligned to have its address be a multiple of 8, then the value can be read or written with a single memory operation. Otherwise, we may need to perform two memory accesses, since the object might be split across two 8-byte memory blocks.

When data types are aligned to their own size, it means that the starting address of each data type must be a multiple of its size. For example, a 4-byte int variable will be aligned on a 4-byte boundary, and an 8-byte double variable will be aligned on an 8-byte boundary.

This is known as "natural alignment", because it aligns data types to their natural size, which can improve the performance of the system by reducing the number of memory accesses and increasing the speed of data access.

For example, in x86-64 architecture and Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems, most data types are aligned on their natural alignment, if the int variable is 4 bytes, it starts at a 4 bytes boundary, if it is 8 bytes, then it starts at an 8 bytes boundary. This will make memory access faster because it will make sure that the data that is accessed is in the cache and not in the main memory.

q; what does an assembly line like .align 8 do?
a; In assembly language, the ".align" directive is used to align the location counter (also known as the program counter) to a specific boundary. The number that follows the ".align" directive (in this case, 8) specifies the boundary to align to. In other words, it ensures that the next instruction or data item will be stored at an address that is a multiple of 8.

For example, consider the following piece of assembly code:
```c
.data
myvar:  .byte    12           ; this variable is stored at memory address 0x1000
        .align   8
myvar2: .byte    42           ; this variable is stored at memory address 0x1008 (after aligning the memory address to multiple of 8)
```

In this example, the variable "myvar" is assigned the value 12 and it is stored at memory address 0x1000. However, this address is not a multiple of 8, so when the assembler encounters the ".align 8" directive, it will insert enough bytes of padding (in this case 8 bytes) to align the address to the next multiple of 8, which is 0x1008. Then, the variable "myvar2" is assigned the value 42 and it is stored at the newly aligned address (memory address 0x1008).

You can also note that memory address 0x1001 to 0x1007 is not assigned any value and if you would access it, it would give you undefined behaviour.

q: For each of the following structure declarations, determine the offset of each field, the total size of the structure, and its alignment requirement for x86-64:

 1)  `struct P1 { int i; char c; int j; char d; };`
 
| i | c | j | d | Total | Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|-------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16    | 4        |

2) struct P2 { int i; char c; char d; long j; };
| i | c | d | j | Total | Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|-------|----------|
| 0 | 4 | 5 | 8 | 16    | 8        |

3) struct P3 { short w[3]; char c[3] };
| w | c | Total | Alignment |
|---|---|-------|----------|
| 0 | 6 | 10    | 2        |

4) struct P4 { short w[5]; char *c[3] };

| w | c | Total | Alignment |
|---|---|-------|----------|
| 0 | 16 | 40    | 8        |

5) struct P5 { struct P3 a[2]; struct P2 t };

| a | t | Total | Alignment |
|---|---|-------|----------|
| 0 | 24 | 40    | 8        |

```c
struct {
	char	*a;
	short	b;
	double	c;
	char	d;
	float	e;
	char	f;
	long	g;
	int	h;
} rec;
1.  What are the byte offsets of all the fields in the structure?
    
2.  What is the total size of the structure?
    
3.  Rearrange the fields of the structure to minimize wasted space, and then show the byte offsets and total size for the rearranged structure.
```

1.
| Field | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
|-------|----|---|----|---|----|---|----|---|
| Size  | 8 | 2 | 8 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 4 |
| Offset| 0 | 8 | 16 | 24| 28 | 32| 40 | 48|

q: why is the offset for c at 16?
a: there is 6 bytes of padding between member "b" and "c" to get to 16 bytes. The padding is added to meet the alignment requirement for "c" which is 8 bytes, so 6 bytes of padding is added before "c" to align it correctly.

| Field | a | c | g | e | h | b | d | f |
