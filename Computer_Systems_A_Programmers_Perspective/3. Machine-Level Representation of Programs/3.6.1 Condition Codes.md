 the CPU maintains a set of single-bit _condition code_ registers describing attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation. These registers can then be tested to perform conditional branches
 
-   cf: Carry flag. The most recent operation generated a carry out of the most significant bit. Used to detect overflow for unsigned operations.
    
-   zf: Zero flag. The most recent operation yielded zero.
    
-   sf: Sign flag. The most recent operation yielded a negative value.
    
-   of: Overflow flag. The most recent operation caused a two's-complement overflow—either negative or positive.

For example, suppose we used one of the add instructions to perform the equivalent of the C assignment `t = a+b`, where variables `a, b`, and `t` are integers. Then the condition codes would be set according to the following C expressions:

```

CF	(unsigned) t < (unsigned) a		Unsigned overflow
ZF	(t == 0)				Zero
SF	(t < 0)					Negative
OF	(a < 0 == b < 0) && (t < 0 ! = a < 0)	Signed overflow
```
