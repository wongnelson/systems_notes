q; what is leaq?
a; is a x86 assembly instruction that loads the effective address of an operand into a register. It is similar to the `mov` instruction, but instead of moving the value stored at a memory location into a register, it loads the address of the memory location into a register.

The syntax of the `leaq` instruction is: `leaq destination, sourceI`

The destination operand is a register and the source operand is a memory location, which can be represented in different forms such as an offset, base and index.

Here are some examples of how `leaq` instruction can be used:
```c
leaq (%rdi, %rsi, 2), %rax   ; load the effective address of the memory location at (rdi + (rsi*2)) into rax
leaq 8(%rdi), %rax           ; load the effective address of the memory location 8 bytes after the address in rdi into rax
leaq (%rdi, %rsi, 4), %rax   ; load the effective address of the memory location at (rdi + (rsi*4)) into rax
```
The `leaq` instruction can also be used to load a constant value into a register, such as:
```c
leaq $0x8, %rax   ; load the effective address of the constant value 0x8 into rax
```

`leaq` instruction is generally faster than the `mov` instruction when the source operand is a complex memory location, because it does not need to access memory to fetch the value. It is also useful for calculating memory addresses for pointer arithmetic operations.

It's worth noting that `leaq` is not the same as `lea` instruction, the `lea` instruction is a 32-bit instruction, while `leaq` is a 64-bit instruction.

q; how does leaq not access memory?
a; When the `leaq` instruction is used to calculate the effective address of a memory location, the destination register (in this case, %rax) will contain the address of the memory location, not the value stored at that memory location. It's just loading the effective address


q; example of how to use leaq for simple arithmetic
As an illustration of the use of `leaq` in compiled code, consider the following C program:

```c

long scale(long x, long y, long z) {
    long t = x + 4 * y + 12 * z;
    return t;
}
```

When compiled, the arithmetic operations of the function are implemented by a sequence of three `leaq` functions, as is documented by the comments on the right-hand side:

```c

  long scale(long x, long y, long z)
  x in %rdi, y in %rsi, z in %rdx
scale:
  leaq	(%rdi,%rsi,4), %rax		x + 4*y
  leaq	(%rdx,%rdx,2), %rdx		z + 2*z = 3*z
  leaq	(%rax,%rdx,4), %rax		(x+4*y) + 4*(3*z) = x + 4*y + 12*z
  ret
```

The ability of the `leaq` instruction to perform addition and limited forms of multiplication proves useful when compiling simple arithmetic expressions such as this example.
