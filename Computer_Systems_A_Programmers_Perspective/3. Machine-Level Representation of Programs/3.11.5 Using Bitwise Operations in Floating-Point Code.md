- The GCC compiler will sometimes generate code that uses bitwise operations on XMM registers in order to achieve specific results for floating-point calculations.

1.  Consider the following C function, where `EXPR` is a macro defined with #define:
    
    ```c
    
    double simplefun(double x)
    {
    	return EXPR(x);
    }
    ```
    
    Below, we show the AVX2 code generated for different definitions of `EXPR`, where value x is held in `%xmm0`. All of them correspond to some useful operation on floating-point values. Identify what the operations are. Your answers will require you to understand the bit patterns of the constant words being retrieved from memory.
    
    1.  ```
        
        1	  vmovsd	.LC1(%rip), %xmm1
        2	  vandpd	%xmm1, %xmm0, %xmm0
        3	.LC1:
        4	  .long		4294967295
        5	  .long		2147483647
        6	  .long		0
        7	  .long		0
        ```
		1.  We see here that the 16 bytes starting at address `.LC1` form a mask, where the low-order 8 bytes contain all ones, except for the most significant bit, which is the sign bit of a double-precision value. When we compute the AND of this mask with `%xmm0`, it will clear the sign bit of `x`, yielding the absolute value. In fact, we generated this code by defining `EXPR(x)` to be `fabs(x)`, where `fabs` is defined in `<math.h>.`

 Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code calculates the absolute value of a packed double-precision floating-point value:

1.  Load the constant value into an XMM register: The first instruction, `vmovsd .LC1(%rip), %xmm1`, loads the constant value stored at memory location `.LC1` into the XMM register `%xmm1`. The constant value is a packed double-precision floating-point value represented as a sequence of 4 long integers.
    
2.  Perform the bitwise AND operation: The second instruction, `vandpd %xmm1, %xmm0, %xmm0`, performs a bitwise AND operation between the packed double-precision floating-point value stored in `%xmm1` and the packed double-precision floating-point value stored in `%xmm0`. The result of the operation is stored in `%xmm0`.
    

In this operation, each bit in the result is set to 1 if both corresponding bits in the operands are 1, and 0 otherwise. In other words, the operation performs a logical AND operation between the corresponding bits of the two packed double-precision floating-point values.

3.  Calculate the absolute value: The packed double-precision floating-point value stored in `%xmm1` is a constant value that represents a mask with all bits set to 1, except for the most significant bit, which is the sign bit of a double-precision value. When the bitwise AND operation is performed between the mask and the packed double-precision floating-point value stored in `%xmm0`, it will clear the sign bit of the packed double-precision floating-point value, yielding its absolute value.

So, to summarize, the code calculates the absolute value of a packed double-precision floating-point value by performing a bitwise AND operation between the packed double-precision floating-point value and a constant mask represented as a packed double-precision floating-point value. The result of the operation is the absolute value of the packed double-precision floating-point value.
        
    2.  
        
      vxorpd	%xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0
        

        1.  We see that the vxorpd instruction sets the entire register to zero, and so this is a way to generate floating-point constant 0.0.
    3.  ```
        
        1	  vmovsd	.LC2(%rip), %xmm1
        2	  vxorpd	%xmm1, %xmm0, %xmm0
        3	.LC2:	
        4	  .long		0
        5	  .long		-2147483648
        6	  .long		0
        7	  .long		0
        ```
        1.  We see that the 16 bytes starting at address `.LC2` form a mask with a single 1 bit, at the position of the sign bit for the low-order value in the XMM register. When we compute the EXCLUSIVE-OR of this mask with `%xmm0`, we change the sign of `x`, computing the expression `-x`.
