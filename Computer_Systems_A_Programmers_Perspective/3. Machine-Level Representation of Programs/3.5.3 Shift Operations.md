#### q; what type of shifts are possible?
a; logical and arithmetic shifts
**Logical shift** correspond to (left-shift) multiplication by 2, (right-shift) integer division by 2.

**Arithmetic shift** is something related to 2's-complement representation of signed numbers. In this representation, the sign is the leftmost bit, then arithmetic shift preserves the sign (this is called sign extension).

#### q; with a 1-byte shift - what range can it encode?
a; 2^8-1 = 255,

q; why ^?
a; The reason for this is that the range of valid shift amounts is determined by the number of bits used to encode the shift amount. In this case, it's using 1 byte (8 bits) to encode the shift amount.

In binary representation, 8 bits can represent a maximum of 28 = 256 different values, but one of these values (0) is used to represent the case when no shift is required.

This means that when the shift amount is 0, the instruction should not perform any shift operation on the data.

So, the range of valid shift amounts is from 1 to 255 (256-1) instead of 0 to 255.

#### q; on x86-64, how are shift amounts for a shift instruction that are w bit long determined?
a; from the low-order m bits of register %cl, where 2^m = w. The higher-order bits are ignored.

So, for example, when register %cl has hexadecimal value 0xFF, then instruction salb would shift by 7
The reason for this is that the shift amount is determined from the low-order m bits of register %cl, where 2^m = w. And the lowest m bits of 0xFF is equal to 7.

#### **q; for ^, how is the lowest m bits of 0xFF equal to 7?**
a;
to get the lowest m bits of 0xFF, we can use a bitmask. A bitmask is a sequence of binary digits that are used to filter out certain bits of a binary value.

Here's an example of how we can get the lowest m bits of 0xFF:

-   Assume that the value stored in %cl is 0xFF, which is equivalent to 11111111 in binary representation.
    
-   To get the lowest m bits, where m = 3, we can use a bitmask of the form 00000111, which is 0x07 in hexadecimal representation.
    
-   We perform a bitwise AND operation between the value stored in %cl and the bitmask, this will filter out all the bits except the lowest m bits.

	`0xFF  & 0x07 = 0x07`

-   we got 0x07 as the result, which is equal to 7 in decimal representation and the lowest 3 bits of 0xFF is equal to 7.
    
-   Similarly, if we want to get the lowest m bits of 0xFF where m = 4, we can use a bitmask of the form 00001111, which is 0x0F in hexadecimal representation.

	`0xFF  & 0x0F = 0x0F`
-   we got 0x0F as the result, which is equal to 15 in decimal representation and the lowest 4 bits of 0xFF is equal to 15.

It's worth noting that the value of m is based on the size of the data you want to shift, in the case of salb instruction (8-bit data) m is 3, in the case of salw instruction (16-bit data) m is 4, in the case of sall instruction (32-bit data) m is 5 and in the case of salq instruction (64-bit data) m is 6.

#### q; why is the register %cl special?
a; 
the %cl register is special because it is used as a shift count register for some instructions.

The instruction set has a few instructions that shift or rotate the values in registers or memory locations by a specified number of bits, such as `sal` , `sar` and `ror`. These instructions use a constant value or an immediate value as the shift count. However, in x86-64 architecture, these instructions also support using the value stored in the %cl register as the shift count.

The reason for this is that it allows for more flexibility in the code and more compact encoding for the instruction, instead of having different instructions for each shift count, the instructions can use %cl as the shift count.

It's worth noting that using %cl as the shift count is only available in x86-64 architecture, and the shift amount is determined from the low-order m bits of register %cl, where 2^m = w, this means that the instruction will use the lowest m bits of %cl as the shift count where m is based on the size of the data you want to shift, this allows the instruction to support a wide range of shift counts.

It's also worth noting that in x86 architecture, the shift count is an immediate value encoded in the instruction, not a register value.


#### problem 3.9
```c
C function:
long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n)
{
  x ≪= 4;
  x ≫= n;
  return x;
}

The assembly version is:
long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n)
	x in %rdi, n in %rsi
shift_left4_rightn:
	movq	%rdi, %rax	Get x. # we move it in %rax because it's the return register
	salq	$4, %rax	x <<= 4
	movl	%esi, %ecx	Get n (4 bytes)
- - - 
The instruction "movl %esi, %ecx" is used to move the value of n from the %rsi register (which is a 64-bit register) to the %ecx register (which is a 32-bit register) . The "movl" instruction stands for "move long" and is used to move a value from one register to another, in this case it is used to move a 32-bit value from the %rsi register to the %ecx register.

The reason why this instruction is used is to limit the shift count to 4 bytes which is the size of %ecx register. The "sarq" instruction can only shift a quadword (64-bit) register by a value between 0 and 255, if the value of n is greater than 255, it will cause an undefined behavior. Since the maximum shift count is 8-bit but the value of n is stored in 64-bit register %rsi, the instruction "movl %esi, %ecx" is used to copy the 4 least significant bytes of %rsi to %ecx.

In this way, the value of n that is used as the shift count is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 255, avoiding any undefined behavior.

Additionally, by moving the n to a smaller register, it also reduces the overhead of moving a large value from one register to another.

	sarq	%cl, %rax	x >>= n

```

the instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" is used to perform a shift right operation on the value stored in the %rax register, using the value stored in the %cl register as the shift count. The C operation "x >>= n" is equivalent to dividing x by 2^n and is commonly used to perform bitwise operations.

In the assembly code, the value of x is stored in the %rax register and the value of n is stored in the %ecx register after moving it from %rsi register. The instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" is used to shift the bits in the %rax register to the right by the number of positions specified in the %cl register.

In this case, the shift count is stored in the %cl register, which is the least significant byte of the %ecx register. The instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" is used to shift the bits in the %rax register to the right by the value stored in the %cl register. The value stored in the %cl register corresponds to the value of n, which is the number of positions that the bits in the %rax register should be shifted to the right.

So in this case, the instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" is used to perform the operation x >>= n, where x is stored in %rax and n is stored in %ecx. The instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" is used to shift the bits of x to the right by the value of n positions and preserves the sign of the number.

The value stored in the %cl register is obtained from the instruction "movl %esi, %ecx" that moves the value of n from the %rsi register (which is a 64-bit register) to the %ecx register (which is a 32-bit register) . The "movl" instruction stands for "move long" and is used to move a value from one register to another, in this case it is used to move a 32-bit value from the %rsi register to the %ecx register.

In the assembly code, the variable n is passed as an argument to the function and is stored in the %rsi register, the instruction "movl %esi, %ecx" is used to move the 4 least significant bytes of the value stored in the %rsi register to the %ecx register.

The instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" uses the least significant byte of the %ecx register which is the %cl register as the shift count. The instruction "sarq" shifts the bits in the %rax register to the right by the number of positions specified in the %cl register. The value stored in the %cl register corresponds to the value of n, which is the number of positions that the bits in the %rax register should be shifted to the right.

In this way, the instruction "movl %esi, %ecx" is used to obtain the value of n and to use it in the instruction "sarq %cl, %rax" as a shift count.
