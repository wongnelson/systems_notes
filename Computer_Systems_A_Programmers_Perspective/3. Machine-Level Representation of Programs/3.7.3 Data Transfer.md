q; generally, passing data to and from procedures take place how?
a; through registers

- With x86-64, up to six integral (i.e., integer and pointer) arguments can be passed via registers

q; what are the 6 registers?
a; (rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9)
q; what happens if there's more than 6?
	a; The additional arguments on the stack will be accessed by the called function using the stack pointer and the stack frame pointer. The stack frame pointer (FP) is used to access local variables and function parameters, it points to the beginning of the current stack frame.

### 3.33
A C function `procprob` has four arguments `u, a, v`, and `b`. Each is either a signed number or a pointer to a signed number, where the numbers have different sizes. The function has the following body:

```c

*u += a;
*v += b;
return sizeof(a) + sizeof(b);
```

It compiles to the following x86-64 code:

```c

1	procprob:
2	movslq %edi, %rdi
3	addq %rdi, (%rdx)
4	addb %sil, (%rcx)
5   movl $6, %eax
6   ret
```
Ans:
An annotated version of this function explains these details:

```c

	int procprobl(int a, short b, long *u, char *v)
	a in %edi, b in %si, u in %rdx, v in %rcx
1	procprob:
2	  movslq	%edi, %rdi	Convert a to long
3	  addq		%rdi, (%rdx)	Add to *u (long)
4	  addb		%sil, (%rcx)	Add low-order byte of b to *v
5	  movl		$6, %eax	Return 4+2
6	  ret
```
