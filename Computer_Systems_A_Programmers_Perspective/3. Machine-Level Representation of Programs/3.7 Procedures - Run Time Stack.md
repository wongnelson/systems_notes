q; what do procedures do?
a; they provide a way to package code that implements some functionality with a designed set of arguments and an optional return value.

 For discussion purposes, suppose procedure `P` calls procedure `Q`, and `Q` then executes and returns back to `P`. These actions involve one or more of the following mechanisms:

-   Passing control. The program counter must be set to the starting address of the code for `Q` upon entry and then set to the instruction in `P` following the call to `Q` upon return.
    
-   Passing data. `P` must be able to provide one or more parameters to `Q`, and `Q` must be able to return a value back to `P`.
    
-   Allocating and deallocating memory. `Q` may need to allocate space for local variables when it begins and then free that storage before it returns.

### 3.7.1 The Run Time Stack
q; how does the stack grow?
a; towards lower addreses 

q; how can you make space for data with no specified initial value on the stack?
a; by decrementing the stack pointer by the appropiate amount

q; when a prodecure requires storage beyond what it can hold in registers, where does it go?
a; on the stack - as part of the stack frame
