q; Unlike integer arithmetic operations, AVX floating-point operations cannot have immediate values as operands. What must the compiler do instead?
a; the compiler must allocate and initialize storage for any constant value.  Code then reads the values from memory

-  - - 
```c
double cel2fahr(double temp)
{
	return 1.8 * temp + 32.0;
}
```

The relevant parts of the x86-64 assembly code are as follows:

```c

	double cel2fahr(double temp) temp in %xmm0
1	cel2fahr:
2	  vmulsd	.LC2(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0	Multiply by 1.8
3	  vaddsd	.LC3(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0	Add 32.0
4	  ret
5	.LC2:
6	  .long	3435973837				Low-order 4 bytes of 1.8
7	  .long	1073532108				High-order 4 bytes of 1.8
8	.LC3:
9	  .long	0					Low-order 4 bytes of 32.0
10	  .long	1077936128				High-order 4 bytes of 32.0
```

q; how is .LC2 interpreted as a decimal?
a; 
1) Looking at the declaration labeled .`LC2`, we see that the two values are 3435973837 (`0xcccccccd`) and 1073532108 (`0x3ffccccc`.)
2) Since the machine uses little-endian byte ordering, the first value gives the low-order 4 bytes, while the second gives the high-order 4 bytes.
3) From the high-order bytes, we can extract an exponent field of `0x3ff` (1023), from which we subtract a bias of 1023 to get an exponent of 0

For 64-bit floating-point numbers, the bias is 1023 because the exponent field in the representation uses 11 bits, which can represent a range of numbers from 0 to 2^11 - 1

4)  Concatenating the fraction bits of the two values, we get a fraction field of `0xccccccccccccd`, which can be shown to be the fractional binary representation of 0.8, to which we add the implied leading one to get 1.8.
0xccccccc + ccccc = 12 - the number of c's in ^

I skipped the part on .LC3
