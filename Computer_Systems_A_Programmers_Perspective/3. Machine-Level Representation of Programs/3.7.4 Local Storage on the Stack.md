q; why at some times, local storage must be in memory?
a; 
-   There are not enough registers to hold all of the local data.
    
-   The address operator ``&`' is applied to a local variable, and hence we must be able to generate an address for it.
    
-   Some of the local variables are arrays or structures and hence must be accessed by array or structure references. We will discuss this possibility when we describe how arrays and structures are allocated.

q; how is space for local variables created?
a; by decrementing the stack ptr - which creates the "local variables" label
