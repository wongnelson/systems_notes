1.  The following code computes the 128-bit product of two 64-bit signed values x and y and stores the result in memory:
    
    ```
    
    1	typedef __int128 int128_t;
    2	
    3	void store_prod(int128_t *dest, int64_t x, int64_t y) {
    4	*dest = x * (int128_t) y;
    5	}
    ```
    
    Gcc generates the following assembly code implementing the computation:
    
    ```
    
    1	store_prod:
    2	movq	%rdx, %rax
    3	cqto	
    4	movq	%rsi, %rcx
    5	sarq	$63, %rcx
    6	imulq	%rax, %rcx
    7	imulq	%rsi, %rdx
    8	addq	%rdx, %rcx
    9	mulq	%rsi
    1	addq	%rcx, %rdx
    1	movq	%rax, (%rdi)
    1	movq	%rdx, 8(%rdi)
    1	ret

    This code uses three multiplications for the multiprecision arithmetic required to implement 128-bit arithmetic on a 64-bit machine. Describe the algorithm used to compute the product, and annotate the assembly code to show how it realizes your algorithm. _Hint:_ When extending arguments of x and y to 128 bits, they can be rewritten as x = 264 · _xh_ + _xl_ and y = 264 · _yh_ + _yl_, where _xh_, _xl_, _yh_, and _yl_ are 64-bit values. Similarly, the 128-bit product can be written as p = 264 · _ph_ + _pl_, where _ph_ and _pl_ are 64-bit values. Show how the code computes the values of _ph_ and _pl_ in terms of _xh_, _xl_, _yh_, and _yl_.

**NOTE** - https://dreamanddead.github.io/CSAPP-3e-Solutions/chapter3/3.59/ might be a better ans
The algorithm used in the code is to perform 128-bit arithmetic on a 64-bit machine. The 128-bit product of two 64-bit signed values x and y is computed using the following steps:

1.  Extend the arguments x and y to 128-bits by rewriting x = 264 · xh + xl and y = 264 · yh + yl, where xh, xl, yh, and yl are 64-bit values.
    
2.  Compute the 128-bit product p = 264 · ph + pl, where ph and pl are 64-bit values.
    
3.  Store the result in memory.
    

Here's an annotated version of the assembly code:

```c
store_prod:

2.  movq	%rdx, %rax      # Move the value of x (in register %rdx) to register %rax

3.  cqto                 # Sign-extend %rax to 128-bit and store the result in %rdx:%rax

4.  movq	%rsi, %rcx      # Move the value of y (in register %rsi) to register %rcx

5.  sarq	$63, %rcx      # Shift the value in %rcx to the right by 63 bits, effectively copying the sign bit of %rcx to the other 63 bits

6.  imulq	%rax, %rcx      # Multiply the values in %rax and %rcx, and store the result in %rcx
    # This result is the high 64-bits of the 128-bit product (ph)

7.  imulq	%rsi, %rdx      # Multiply the values in %rsi and %rdx, and store the result in %rdx
    # This result is the low 64-bits of the 128-bit product (pl)

8.  addq	%rdx, %rcx      # Add the values in %rdx and %rcx, and store the result in %rcx
    # This result is the 128-bit product (ph + pl)

9.  mulq	%rsi            # Multiply %rax and %rsi, and store the result in %rdx:%rax
    # This operation is not required, but is performed to restore the original value of y

1.  addq	%rcx, %rdx      # Add the values in %rcx and %rdx, and store the result in %rdx

1.  movq	%rax, (%rdi)    # Store the low 64-bits of the 128-bit product (pl) in memory at the address in %rdi

1.  movq	%rdx, 8(%rdi)   # Store the high 64-bits of the 128-bit product (ph) in memory at the address 8 bytes after the address in %rdi

1.  ret                 # Return from the function

```

q: why would you want to copy he sign bit of the value in %rcx to the other 63 bits?
a; Copying the sign bit of the value in `%rcx` to the other 63 bits is useful in this code because it is used to calculate the high 64-bits of the 128-bit product (`ph`).

When multiplying two 64-bit numbers `x` and `y` to get a 128-bit product, the high 64-bits of the product can be calculated as `xh * yh + ((xl * yh + xh * yl) >> 64)`. The `sarq` instruction is used to perform the right shift by 64 bits, which effectively discards the lower 64 bits and keeps the high 64 bits of the intermediate result `(xl * yh + xh * yl)`.

The `sarq` instruction also sets the sign bit of the result to be the same as the original sign bit of the value in `%rcx`. This ensures that the sign of the intermediate result is preserved, which is important for correctly computing the high 64-bits of the 128-bit product.
