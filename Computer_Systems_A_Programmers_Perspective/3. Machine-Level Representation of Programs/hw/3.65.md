1.  The following code transposes the elements of an M × M array, where M is a constant defined by `#define`:
    
    ```c
    
    1	void transpose(long A[M][M]) {
    2		long i, j;
    3		for (i = 0; i < M; i++)
    4			for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    5				long t = A[i][j];
    6				A[i][j] = A[j][i];
    7				A[j][i] = t;
    8			}
    9	}
    ```
    
    When compiled with optimization level –01, gcc generates the following code for the inner loop of the function:
    
    ```c
    
    1	.L6:
    2	  movq	(%rdx), %rcx
    3	  movq	(%rax), %rsi
    4	  movq	%rsi, (%rdx)
    5	  movq	%rcx, (%rax)
    6	  addq	$8, %rdx
    7	  addq	$120, %rax
    8	  cmpq	%rdi, %rax
    9	  jne	.L6
    ```
    
    We can see that gcc has converted the array indexing to pointer code.
    
    1.  Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[i][j]?`
	he instruction `addq $8, %rdx` provides a clue that the register %rdx holds a pointer to the current element in A[i][j].

The addition of 8 to %rdx indicates that the value stored in the register is being updated to point to the next element in an array. This is consistent with the behavior of a pointer, which is used to access and traverse elements in an array.

The size of each element in the array A is 8 bytes, as indicated by the addition of 8 to %rdx. This information, combined with the fact that the value stored in %rdx is being updated to point to the next element in an array, suggests that %rdx holds a pointer to the current element in `A[i][j]`.

In conclusion, the instruction `addq $8, %rdx` provides a clue that the register %rdx holds a pointer to the current element in `A[i][j]` by indicating that the value stored in %rdx is being updated to point to the next element in an array of a known size.
        
    2.  Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[j][i]?`
	%rax
        
    3.  What is the value of M?
The value of M being equal to 15 can be deduced from the information given in the code. The instruction `addq $120, %rax` updates the pointer stored in %rax to point to the next element in the next row of the array. The addition of 120 to %rax corresponds to adding the size of each element in the row (8 bytes) multiplied by the number of elements in a row (M).

Therefore, we can calculate the value of M as follows:

120 / 8 = 15

So, M = 15.

This information, combined with the fact that the value stored in %rax is being updated to point to the next element in the next row of the array, suggests that M is equal to 15.

  jne	.L6                                  # If the values are not equal, jump to the label .L6
                                            # If the values stored in %rdi and %rax are not equal, the loop continues by jumping back to the label .L6. If the values are equal, the loop will terminate.
