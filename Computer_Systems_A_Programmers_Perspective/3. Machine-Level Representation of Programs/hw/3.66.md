1.  Consider the following source code, where `NR` and `NC` are macro expressions declared with `#define` that compute the dimensions of array A in terms of parameter n. This code computes the sum of the elements of column j of the array.
    
    ```c
    
    1	long sum_col(long n, long A[NR(n)][NC(n)], long j) {
    2		long i;
    3		long result = 0;
    4		for (i = 0; i < NR(n); i++)
    5			result += A[i][j];
    6		return result;
    7	}
    ```
    
    In compiling this program, gcc generates the following assembly code:
    
    ```c
    
    	long sum_col(long n, long A[NR(n)][NC(n)], long j)
		# n in %rdi, A in %rsi, j in %rdx
sum_col:
  leaq 1(,%rdi,4), %r8        # t1 = n*4 + 1
  leaq (%rdi,%rdi,2), %rax    # t2 = n*3
  movq %rax, %rdi             # t3 = n*3
  testq %rax, %rax            # test n*3
  jle .L4                     # n*3 <= 0, jump .L4
  salq $3, %r8                # t1 = t1*8 = 8*(n*4 + 1)
  leaq (%rsi,%rdx,8), %rcx    # t4 = j*8 + A
  movl $0, %eax               # t2 = 0
  movl $0, %edx               # t5 = 0
.L3:
  addq (%rcx), %rax           # t2 = *(t4) = *(A + j*8)
  addq $1, %rdx               # t5 = t5+1
  addq %r8, %rcx              # t4 = t1+t4 = A + j*8 + 8*(n*4 + 1)
  cmpq %rdi, %rdx             # cmp t5 & t3
  jne .L3                     # if t5 != n*3, loop
  rep
  ret
.L4:
  movl $0, %eax               # return 0
  ret
    ```
    
    Use your reverse engineering skills to determine the definitions of `NR` and `NC`.

Note: Look closely on how the operations for rdi moves

The value of t5 (i.e. %rdx) is being compared to the value of t3 (i.e. %rdi) in the following instruction:

cmpq %rdi, %rdx # cmp t5 & t3 jne .L3 # if t5 != n*3, loop

So, t3 represents the value that t5 is being compared to, and if t5 is not equal to t3, the loop continues. Hence, t3 can be considered as the limit of the loop variable t5 (i.e. the variable i in the original code).

The value of t3 is computed as follows:

leaq (%rdi,%rdi,2), %rax # t2 = n_3 movq %rax, %rdi # t3 = n_3

Here, t2 is calculated as n * 3 using the lea (load effective address) instruction, and then the result is moved to t3.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, it can be deduced that NR(n) == n * 3.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">NC</mark>:
"in every loop, pointer move `8*(n*4 + 1)` bytes, so `NC(n) == n*4 + 1`" - dreamana

The value of t4 (i.e. %rcx) represents the address of the current element being processed in the loop, which is computed as follows:

leaq (%rsi,%rdx,8), %rcx # t4 = j*8 + A

Here, t4 is calculated as `j * 8 + A`, where `j` is the column index passed as an argument to the `sum_col` function, and `A` is the array being processed.

In each iteration of the loop, the value of t4 is updated by adding t1 (i.e. %r8), which is calculated as follows:

leaq 1(,%rdi,4), %r8 # t1 = n_4 + 1 ... salq $3, %r8 # t1 = t1_8 = 8*(n_4 + 1) ... addq %r8, %rcx # t4 = t1+t4 = A + j_8 + 8*(n*4 + 1)

Here, t1 is calculated as `n * 4 + 1` using the lea instruction, and then multiplied by 8 using the sal instruction. The value of t1 is then added to t4 in the `addq` instruction.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, it can be deduced that the stride of the loop, i.e. the number of bytes to add to the current address (t4) for each iteration of the loop, is `8 * (n * 4 + 1)`. This means that the number of columns in the array is `n * 4 + 1`, so NC(n) == n * 4 + 1.
