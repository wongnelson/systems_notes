Consider the following union declaration:

```c

1	union ele {
2		struct {
3			long *p;
4			long y;
5		} e1;
6		struct {
7			long x;
8			union ele *next;
9		} e2;
10	};
```

This declaration illustrates that structures can be embedded within unions.
1.  What are the offsets (in bytes) of the following fields:
    
    ```
    e1.p	0 The offset of "p" will be 0, since it is the first member of the struct "e1".
    e1.y	The offset of "y" will be 8, since it is the second member of the struct "e1" and is 8 bytes away from the first member.
    e2.x	0
    e2.next	8
    ```
2.  How many total bytes does the structure require?
a; 16 - both the structs are 16bytes

3. The compiler generates the following assembly code for proc:

```
	void proc (union ele *up) up in %rdi
1	proc:
2	movq	8(%rdi), %rax
3	movq	(%rax), %rdx
4	movq	(%rdx), %rdx
5	subq	8(%rax), %rdx
6	movq	%rdx, (%rdi)
7	ret
```
```
1	void proc (union ele *up) {
2		up-> _____ = *(_____) - _____;
3	}
```
On the basis of this information, fill in the missing expressions in the code for `proc.` _Hint:_ Some union references can have ambiguous interpretations. These ambiguities get resolved as you see where the references lead. There is only one answer that does not perform any casting and does not violate any type constraints.

Commented Assembly  code

```c
proc:
  # Load the value stored at the memory location 8 bytes after the location represented by the `%rdi` register into the `%rax` register
  # This corresponds to loading the value of "up->e2.next" into the `%rax` register.
  movq 8(%rdi), %rax

  # Load the value stored at the memory location represented by the `%rax` register into the `%rdx` register
  # This corresponds to loading the value of "*(up->e2.next).e1.p" into the `%rdx` register.
  movq (%rax), %rdx

  # Load the value stored at the memory location represented by the `%rdx` register into the `%rdx` register
  # This corresponds to loading the value of "*(*(up->e2.next).e1.p)" into the `%rdx` register.
  movq (%rdx), %rdx

  # Subtract the value stored at the memory location 8 bytes after the location represented by the `%rax` register from the value stored in the `%rdx` register.
  # This corresponds to subtracting "*(up->e2.next).e1.y" from "*(*(up->e2.next).e1.p)".
  subq 8(%rax), %rdx

  # Store the value stored in the `%rdx` register at the memory location represented by the `%rdi` register.
  # This corresponds to storing the result of the subtraction into "up->e2.x".
  movq %rdx, (%rdi)
  ret
```

Ans:
```c
1	void proc (union ele *up) {
2		up->e2.x = *( *(up->e2.next).e1.p ) - *(up->e2.next).e1.y
3	}
```
-   The first instruction `movq 8(%rdi), %rax` loads the value stored at the memory location 8 bytes after the location represented by the `%rdi` register (which holds the value of the "union ele *up" pointer) into the `%rax` register. This corresponds to loading the value of "up->e2.next" into the `%rax` register.
    
-   The second instruction `movq (%rax), %rdx` loads the value stored at the memory location represented by the `%rax` register into the `%rdx` register. This corresponds to loading the value of "*(up->e2.next).e1.p" into the `%rdx` register.
    
-   The third instruction `movq (%rdx), %rdx` loads the value stored at the memory location represented by the `%rdx` register into the `%rdx` register. This corresponds to loading the value of "_(_(up->e2.next).e1.p)" into the `%rdx` register.
    
-   The fourth instruction `subq 8(%rax), %rdx` subtracts the value stored at the memory location 8 bytes after the location represented by the `%rax` register (which holds the value of "up->e2.next") from the value stored in the `%rdx` register. This corresponds to subtracting "_(up->e2.next).e1.y" from "_(*(up->e2.next).e1.p)".
    
-   The fifth instruction `movq %rdx, (%rdi)` stores the value stored in the `%rdx` register at the memory location represented by the `%rdi` register (which holds the value of the "union ele *up" pointer). This corresponds to storing the result of the subtraction into "up->e2.x".
    

The code generates the correct result by navigating the linked list of union elements and performing the subtraction as specified by the original code.
