```c

long cread(long *xp) {
	return (xp ? *xp : 0);
}
```
Write a C function `cread_alt` that has the same behavior as `cread`, except that it can be compiled to use conditional data transfer. When compiled, the generated code should use a conditional move instruction rather than one of the jump instructions.

long cread_alt(long *xp) { return (!xp ? 0 : *xp); }

Youchat answer:
The first example of long cread(long \*xp) contains an operator precedence problem. The conditional operator ?: has lower precedence than the dereference operator \*, so the expression is parsed as (*xp ? *xp : 0) which evaluates to either the value of *xp or 0 depending on the value of xp. However, this is not allowed in C since you cannot use a conditional operator with a pointer.

The second example of long cread_alt(long \*xp) avoids this issue by swapping the order of the two operands. The expression is parsed as (!xp ? 0 : \*xp) which evaluates to either 0 or the value of \*xp depending on the value of xp. This is valid C syntax since the conditional operator ?: is used with a non-pointer operand.
