1.  In the following code, A and B are constants defined with `#define:`
    
    ```c
    
    1	typedef struct {
    2		int x[A][B]; /* Unknown constants A and B */
    3		long y;
    4	} str1;
    5	
    6	typedef struct {
    7		char array[B];
    8		int t;
    9		short s[A];
    10		long u;
    11	} str2;
    12	
    13	void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q) {
    14		long v1 = q-<t;
    15		long v2 = q-<u;
    16		p-<y = v1+v2;
    17	}
    ```
    
    Gcc generates the following code for `setVal:`
    
    ```c
    
    	void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q) p in %rdi, q in %rsi
    1	setVal:
    2	  movslq	8(%rsi), %rax
    3	  addq	32(%rsi), %rax
    4	  movq	%rax, 184(%rdi)
    5	  ret
    ```
    
    What are the values of A and B? (The solution is unique.)
	A = 9
	B = 5

Line 2: why would you do movslq 8(%rsi), %rax?
a; The instruction "movslq 8(%rsi), %rax" is used to load a 32-bit signed value from memory into a register and extend the sign of the value to 64 bits.

The "movslq" instruction is useful in cases where a 32-bit signed value needs to be treated as a 64-bit signed value. By extending the sign of the value, the instruction ensures that the resulting value in the register %rax has the same sign as the original value in memory.

This instruction is used in the assembly code for the function "setVal" to load the value of "q->t" into the register %rax. The value of "q->t" is a 32-bit signed integer, and the instruction "movslq 8(%rsi), %rax" extends the sign of this value to 64 bits so that it can be used in further arithmetic operations.

q; How can you find A = 9
The value of A can be determined by analyzing the offset of the member "s" in the struct "str2". The offset of "s" is given by the expression "24 < 12 + A * 2 <= 32".

The value of "t" is 4 bytes, and "s" is 2 bytes per element, so the offset of "s" is "12 + A * 2".

The value of "u" is 8 bytes and must be aligned on an 8-byte boundary, so the offset of "u" is a multiple of 8. This means that the offset of "s" must also be a multiple of 8, so "A * 2" must be a multiple of 8.

So, we have the inequality "24 < 12 + A * 2 <= 32", which can be rewritten as "12 < A * 2 <= 20". Dividing both sides of the inequality by 2 gives us "6 < A <= 10".

The only value of A that satisfies this inequality and makes "A * 2" a multiple of 8 is 9, so A = 9.

q; B= 5? how?
a; 1.  The size of the array "array" in the struct "str2" is given by the expression "4 < B <= 8".
    
2.  The value of "array" must be a multiple of 4 bytes because it is an array of chars, and each char takes up 1 byte.
    
3.  The value of "t" is 4 bytes, so the size of "array" must be a multiple of 4 that is larger than 4 but less than or equal to 8.
    
4.  The inequality "4 < B <= 8" represents the range of possible values for the size of "array".
    
5.  The possible values of B that satisfy this inequality and make "B" a multiple of 4 are 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    
6.  The only value of B that makes "B" a multiple of 4 and satisfies the inequality is 5, so B = 5.
