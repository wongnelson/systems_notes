Consider the following assembly code:

```c

	long loop(long x, int n)
	x in %rdi, n in %esi
1	loop:
2	  movl	%esi, %ecx
3	  movl	$1, %edx
4	  movl	$0, %eax
5	  jmp	.L2
6	.L3:
7	  movq	%rdi, %r8
8	  andq	%rdx, %r8
9	  orq	%r8, %rax
10	  salq	%cl, %rdx
11	.L2:
12	  testq	%rdx, %rdx
13	  jne	.L3
14	  rep; ret
```

The preceding code was generated by compiling C code that had the following overall form:

```c

1	long loop(long x, long n)
2	{
3		long result = _____;
4		long mask;
5		for (mask = _____; mask _____; mask = _____){
6			result	|	= _____;
7	}
8	return result;
9	}
```

Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the C code to get a program equivalent to the generated assembly code. Recall that the result of the function is returned in register `%rax`. You will find it helpful to examine the assembly code before, during, and after the loop to form a consistent mapping between the registers and the program variables.

1.  Which registers hold program values `x, n, result`, and `mask?`
| val | reg |
|-----|-----|
| x   | %rdi |
| n   | %esi |
| result | %rax |
| mask | %rdx |

q; how do you know that mask is in rdx?
a; The value of `mask` is held in register `%rdx` because of the following instructions in the assembly code:

-   Line 3: `movl $1, %edx` initializes the value of `mask` to 1.
-   Line 10: `salq %cl, %rdx` shifts the value of `mask` left by the number of bits specified in the `%cl` register, which holds the value of `n`.
-   Line 12: `testq %rdx, %rdx` tests the value of `mask` and sets the zero flag if it is 0.
-   Line 13: `jne .L3` jumps to the label `.L3` if the zero flag is not set, meaning that `mask` is not 0.

These instructions demonstrate that `mask` is stored in register `%rdx` and is used as the loop control variable in the assembly code.

2.  What are the initial values of `result` and `mask?`
    0 and 1
3.  What is the test condition for `mask?`
    The test condition for `mask` is `mask != 0`. This is because of the following instructions in the assembly code:

-   Line 12: `testq %rdx, %rdx` tests the value of `mask` by performing a bitwise AND operation between `%rdx` and itself. This sets the zero flag if the result is 0, indicating that `mask` is 0.
-   Line 13: `jne .L3` jumps to the label `.L3` if the zero flag is not set, meaning that `mask` is not 0.

So, the test condition for `mask` is `mask != 0`. The loop will continue as long as `mask` is not 0, and will terminate when `mask` becomes 0.
4.  How does `mask` get updated?
    In the assembly code, `mask` is updated in Line 10: `salq %cl, %rdx`. The instruction `salq %cl, %rdx` shifts the value of `mask` left by the number of bits specified in the `%cl` register, which holds the value of `n`.

So, in each iteration of the loop, `mask` is updated by shifting it left by the value stored in `%cl`, effectively multiplying `mask` by 2. This causes `mask` to become successively larger in each iteration of the loop, until it becomes 0 and the loop terminates.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">q: how do you know cl holds the value n?</mark>
In the assembly code, the value of `n` is stored in register `%esi`. However, in the loop, the value of `n` is used to control the number of bits by which `mask` is shifted left in each iteration. The number of bits to shift is stored in the `%cl` register, which holds the least significant 8 bits of the `%rcx` register.

So, before entering the loop, the value of `n` is moved from register `%esi` to register `%ecx` with the instruction `movl %esi, %ecx`. This sets the least significant 8 bits of `%rcx` (i.e. `%cl`) to the value of `n`. The value of `%cl` is then used in the `salq %cl, %rdx` instruction to control the number of bits by which `mask` is shifted left in each iteration.

Therefore, it can be concluded that `%cl` holds the value of `n` in the assembly code.
5.  How does `result` get updated?
    In the assembly code, `result` is updated in Line 9: `orq %r8, %rax`. The instruction `orq %r8, %rax` performs a bitwise OR operation between the values stored in `%r8` and `%rax` and stores the result in `%rax`.

Before the `orq` instruction, the value of `x & mask` is stored in register `%r8` in Line 8: `andq %rdx, %r8`. The instruction `andq %rdx, %r8` performs a bitwise AND operation between the values stored in `%rdx` (i.e. `mask`) and `%rdi` (i.e. `x`) and stores the result in `%r8`.

So, in each iteration of the loop, the value of `x & mask` is calculated and stored in `%r8`. The instruction `orq %r8, %rax` then performs a bitwise OR operation between the value stored in `%r8` and the value stored in `%rax` (i.e. `result`), and stores the result in `%rax` (i.e. `result`).

Therefore, in each iteration of the loop, `result` is updated by ORing it with the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `mask`. The loop continues as long as `mask` is not 0, updating `result` in each iteration, until `mask` becomes 0 and the loop terminates.
6.  Fill in all the missing parts of the C code.
long loop(long x, int n) {
  long result = 0;
  long mask = 1;
  for (; mask != 0; mask = mask << n) {
    result |= (x & mask);
  }
  return result;
}
