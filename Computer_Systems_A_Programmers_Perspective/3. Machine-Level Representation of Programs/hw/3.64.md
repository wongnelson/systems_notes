Consider the following source code, where R, S, and T are constants declared with `#define`:

```c

1	long A[R][S][T]; 
2
3	long store_ele(long i, long j, long k, long *dest)
4	{
5		*dest = A[i][j][k];
6		return sizeof(A);
7	}
```

In compiling this program, gcc generates the following assembly code:

```c

	long store_ele(long i, long j, long k, long *dest)
	i in %rdi, j in %rsi, k in %rdx, dest in %rcx
1	store_ele:

 leaq (%rsi, %rsi, 2), %rax    # t1 = j*3
  leaq (%rsi, %rax, 4), %rax    # t1 = j*13
  movq %rdi, %rsi               # t2 = i
  salq $6, %rsi                 # t2 = i*64
  addq %rsi, %rdi               # t3 = i*65
  addq %rax, %rdi               # t3 = i*65 + j*13
  addq %rdi, %rdx               # t4 = i*65 + j*13 + k
  movq A(,%rdx,8), %rax         # t1 = *(A + 8*t4)
  movq %rax, (%rcx)             # *dest = t1
  movl $3640, %eax              # return 3640
```

1.  Extend the equation for two dimensions to three to provide a formula for the location of array element `A[i][j][k]`.
```
For 2D
T D[R][C]; 
&D[i][j] = Xd + L(C*i + j) T means type, D means data, R means row, C means column 
L means sizeof(T), Xd means address of D
```
For 3D array it's 

```
&D[i][j][k] = Xd + L * ((R * C * i) + (C * j) + k)

Where Xd is the address of the data array, L is the size of the data type, R is the number of rows, C is the number of columns, and i, j, k are the indices for the respective dimensions.
```
explanation:
Imagine a 3D array `D` with dimensions `R` (number of rows), `C` (number of columns), and `H` (number of "height" or depth). Each element in the first dimension, `D[i]`, can be thought of as a 2D array with `R` rows and `C` columns. The expression `R * C * i` gives the total number of elements in all the 2D arrays before the current one, `D[i]`.

So, to locate an element `D[i][j][k]` in this 3D array, we first calculate the offset from the beginning of the 3D array to the start of the current 2D array `D[i]` using `R * C * i`, and then add the offset to the beginning of `D[i]` to reach the desired element `D[i][j][k]`. The offset within the current 2D array `D[i]` can be calculated as `C * j + k`.

Putting it all together, the memory location of `D[i][j][k]` can be calculated as:

&D\[i]\[j]\[k] = Xd + L * ((R * C * i) + (C * j) + k)

Where `Xd` is the address of the data array, `L` is the size of the data type, `R` is the number of rows, `C` is the number of columns, and `i`, `j`, and `k` are the indices for the respective dimensions.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">q: why is the offset "C * j + k"?</mark>
a; The expression "C * j + k" represents the offset within a 2D array to the desired element in the 3D array.

If we consider a 3D array as an array of 2D arrays (matrices), then each element in the first dimension would represent a 2D array. The second dimension `j` gives the row number within the current 2D array, and the third dimension `k` gives the column number within the current 2D array.

Multiplying the row number `j` by the number of columns `C` gives the number of elements in all the previous rows within the current 2D array. Adding the column number `k` gives the total number of elements before the desired element in the current row. So, the expression "C * j + k" gives the offset from the beginning of the current 2D array to the desired element in the 3D array.

    
2.  Use your reverse engineering skills to determine the values of R, S, and T based on the assembly code.
