q: why does multiplying two 64-bit signed or unsigned integers can yield a product that requires 128 bits to represent?
a; When multiplying two 64-bit integers, the product can exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit integer, which is 2^64-1. The result of the multiplication requires a larger number of bits (128 bits) to accurately represent the value.

For example, the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit unsigned integer is 18446744073709551615 (which is equal to 2^64-1). If we multiply this value by 2, the result is 36893488147419103232, which exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit unsigned integer and requires a 128-bit integer to represent.

```c
The C code is: 
#include <inttypes.h>

typedef unsigned __int128 uint128_t;

void store_uprod(uint128_t *dest, uint64_t x, uint64_t y) {
   *dest = x * (uint128_t) y;
}

The assembly code is:

  void store_uprod(uint128_t *dest, uint64_t x, uint64_t y)
  dest in %rdi, x in %rsi, y in %rdx
1	store_uprod:
2	  movq	%rsi, %rax	Copy x to multiplicand
3	  mulq	%rdx		Multiply by y
4	  movq	%rax, (%rdi)	Store lower 8 bytes at dest
5	  movq	%rdx, 8(%rdi)	Store upper 8 bytes at dest+8
6	  ret

Explain in detail how the assembly code relates to the C code****
```

The C code is a function called "store_uprod" that takes three arguments:

-   a pointer to a 128-bit unsigned integer (dest),
-   a 64-bit unsigned integer (x), and
-   a 64-bit unsigned integer (y).

The purpose of the function is to store the result of multiplying x and y in the memory location pointed to by dest.

The assembly code is the machine code version of the C code, which is specific to the x86-64 architecture. The assembly code and the C code are related as follows:

1.  Line 2: The instruction "movq %rsi, %rax" copies the value of x (stored in the %rsi register) to the %rax register. This register is used as the multiplicand in the multiplication operation.
    
2.  Line 3: The instruction "mulq %rdx" performs the multiplication of the value in the %rax register (which is x) by the value in the %rdx register (which is y). The result of the multiplication is stored in the %rax and %rdx registers.
    
3.  Line 4: The instruction "movq %rax, (%rdi)" stores the lower 8 bytes of the result of the multiplication (which is stored in %rax) at the memory location pointed to by dest (which is in %rdi).
    
4.  Line 5: The instruction "movq %rdx, 8(%rdi)" stores the upper 8 bytes of the result of the multiplication (which is stored in %rdx) at the memory location pointed to by dest+8 (which is 8(%rdi)).
    
5.  Line 6: The instruction "ret" returns from the function, completing the execution of the assembly code.

Note: 
We need two separate instructions to store to %rdi because the multiplication result is too large to fit in a single 64-bit register (i.e. %rax or %rdx). The multiplication result requires 128 bits to represent, but each register can only hold 64 bits. Therefore, the lower 8 bytes of the result are stored in the %rax register and the upper 8 bytes are stored in the %rdx register.

The instruction "movq %rax, (%rdi)" stores the lower 8 bytes of the result of the multiplication (which is stored in %rax) at the memory location pointed to by dest (which is in %rdi). And the instruction "movq %rdx, 8(%rdi)" stores the upper 8 bytes of the result of the multiplication (which is stored in %rdx) at the memory location pointed to by dest+8 (which is 8(%rdi))

This way, the entire 128-bit multiplication result is stored in the memory location pointed to by dest, and it is accessible to the program as a single 128-bit value.

In summary, the assembly code is a low-level representation of the C code that performs the same operations, but uses registers and memory addresses instead of variables, and has specific instructions to perform the operations on the x86-64 architecture.

```c
The C code is: 
void remdiv(long x, long y,
  		long *qp, long *rp) {
  	long q = x/y;
  	long r = x%y;
  	*qp = q;
  	*rp = r;
}

The assembly code is:

  void remdiv(long x, long y, long *qp, long *rp)
  x in %rdi, y in %rsi, qp in %rdx, rp in %rcx
1	remdiv:
2	 movq %rdx, %r8		Copy qp
3	 movq %rdi, %rax	
4	 cqto			Sign-extend to upper 8 bytes of dividend
5	 idivq %rsi		Divide by y
6	 movq %rax, (%r8)	Store quotient at qp
7	 movq %rdx, (%rcx)	Store remainder at rp
8	 ret
```

Line 2: 
The instruction "movq %rdx, %r8" copies the value of qp (which is passed in as a register %rdx) to the register %r8.

The reason why we move %rdx to %r8 specifically is that later on, the instruction "movq %rax, (%r8)" is used to store the quotient in %rax register at the memory location pointed to by %r8 register.  

We're actually repointing where \*qp will be pointing to - from %rdx to %r8

We can't use %rdx register directly because it is being used to store the remainder later on, so we can't change its value. Also, it is not a good practice to use the same register for multiple purposes in assembly.

So, %r8 is used as a temporary register to hold the value of qp and use it later to store the quotient. This allows the %rdx register to be used later for its intended purpose of storing the remainder.

q; how is %rdx used to store the remainder later on?
In the assembly code, the instruction "idivq %rsi" divides the dividend (in %rax register) by the divisor (in %rsi register) and stores the quotient in %rax register and remainder in %rdx register.

This is the Intel syntax for the instruction `idiv` where `q` stands for "quad-word" (64-bits) and `i` stands for signed integers. The instruction performs the operation of signed integer division, dividing the value in the %rax register by the value in the %rsi register and storing the quotient in %rax and remainder in %rdx.

So, after the instruction "idivq %rsi" is executed, the value of the remainder is stored in the %rdx register and the instruction "movq %rdx, (%rcx)" stores the remainder in %rdx register at the memory location pointed to by %rcx register.

This way, %rdx is being used as an intermediate register to hold the remainder and then it is being stored in the memory location pointed by rp.

**q: does idivq always use rdx?**
a; Yes, the instruction idivq uses the %rdx register as an intermediate register when performing signed integer division.

When you use the idiv instruction, the instruction expects the dividend to be a 128-bit value formed by concatenating the contents of the %rdx:%rax registers. The high order 64 bits, %rdx, hold the most significant part of the dividend, and the low order 64 bits, %rax, hold the least significant part of the dividend.

After the division, the quotient is stored in %rax and the remainder is stored in %rdx. So, the idiv instruction always uses %rdx register as an intermediate register to hold the high order 64 bits of the dividend.

It is worth noting that idiv instruction also have the version `div` which is used for unsigned integers and it uses %rdx as well to store the high order 64 bits of the dividend but the result is different.

**q; why movq %rdi, %rax**
a; 
The instruction "movq %rdi, %rax" move the value of x from %rdi register to %rax register. This is done to prepare the dividend for the division operation.

The instruction "idivq %rsi" expects the dividend to be stored in the %rdx:%rax registers, where %rax holds the least significant 64 bits of the dividend and %rdx holds the most significant 64 bits.

So, by moving the value of x from %rdi to %rax, we are ensuring that the least significant 64 bits of the dividend are in the %rax register, and the most significant 64 bits of the dividend are in the %rdx register.


#### q: how is cqto used?
a; 
 The instruction "cqto" is used to sign-extend the contents of the %rdi register to the contents of the %rdx register. This instruction copies the sign bit of the value in the %rdi register to all the bits of the %rdx register.
The instruction "cqto" is used to ensure that the most significant bits of the dividend are set to the same value as the sign bit of the least significant bits, which is the contents of %rdi.

The instruction "idivq %rsi" expects the dividend to be stored in the %rdx:%rdi registers, where %rdi holds the least significant 64 bits of the dividend and %rdx holds the most significant 64 bits.

So, when the instruction "cqto" is executed, it is copying the sign bit of the value in the %rdi register to all the bits of the %rdx register, this ensures that the most significant bits of the dividend have the same sign as the least significant bits, so the instruction "idivq %rsi" can work correctly for signed integers, regardless of the sign of the dividend.

In this way, the instruction "cqto" is used to sign-extend the contents of the %rdi register to the contents of the %rdx register and this guarantees that the dividend is a 128-bit value in the %rdx:%rdi registers, ready to be divided by the divisor in the %rsi register.
