q; explain the command `gcc -Og -o p p1.c p2.c`
a; 
`-0g`  - instructs the compiler to apply a level of optimization that yields machine code that follows the overall structure of the original C codes 

The `-o` flag specifies the name of the output file. In this case, the output file will be named `p`. The `p1.c` and `p2.c` parameters are the names of the input files, which are the source code files that you want to compile.

## <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; what defines the behavior of a machine-level program?</mark>

### What is Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)?

ISA is a set of instructions that defines the behavior of a machine-level program by specifying the instructions that a computer's processor can execute and how those instructions are encoded and interpreted by the processor.

### What is the purpose of ISA?

The purpose of ISA is to provide a standardized set of instructions that can be executed by different processors, allowing software developers to write programs that can run on any processor that supports that ISA.

### What is the benefit of defining the ISA?

Defining the ISA enables hardware manufacturers to design processors that are compatible with a particular ISA, and software developers to write programs that can run on any processor that supports that ISA. This facilitates interoperability and portability between hardware and software.

### Can you provide an example of how ISA defines the behavior of a machine-level program?

Yes, for example, the difference between two processors that use different ISAs, such as one that uses the x86 ISA (used by most personal computers) and another that uses the ARM ISA (used by many mobile devices), demonstrates how the ISA specifies the set of instructions that a processor can execute, thus defining the behavior of a machine-level program.

### How does the ISA impact the compatibility between hardware and software?

The ISA facilitates compatibility between hardware and software by providing a common set of instructions that can be executed by different processors, allowing software written for a particular ISA to run on any processor that supports that ISA, regardless of the specific hardware implementation. This promotes interoperability and portability between hardware and software.

Here is an example of the x86 assembly code that could be used to perform this operation:
```c
mov eax, [0x1000] ; Load the value from memory location 0x1000 into the EAX register
add eax, 5        ; Add 5 to the value in EAX
mov [0x1000], eax ; Store the result back into memory location 0x1000
```

ARM version:
```c
ldr r1, =0x1000   ; Load the memory address 0x1000 into register R1
ldr r2, [r1]      ; Load the value from memory location pointed by R1 into register R2
add r2, r2, #5    ; Add 5 to the value in R2
str r2, [r1]      ; Store the result back into memory location pointed by R1
```

As you can see, the two processors use different instructions and syntax to perform the same operation. The ISA defines the specific set of instructions that each processor can use and how those instructions are encoded and interpreted by the processor, ultimately determining the behavior of machine-level programs executed on each processor.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">q; what's the program counter (PC, called %rip in x86-64)?</mark>
a; The program counter (PC) is a register in the processor that holds the address of the instruction currently being executed. <span style="background:#d3f8b6">After the instruction is executed, the PC is automatically incremented to point to the next instruction</span>, allowing the processor to execute instructions sequentially

### Why is the PC incremented after each instruction execution?

The PC is incremented after each instruction execution to point to the next instruction in memory, ensuring that the CPU can continuously fetch and execute instructions in sequence, as specified by the program.

### What is the increment value usually equal to?

The increment value is usually equal to the size of the instruction in bytes.

Suppose a computer architecture has instructions of varying sizes, such as 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit instructions. If the current instruction being executed is a 16-bit instruction, the PC would be incremented by 2 bytes after the instruction is executed. This would ensure that the PC now points to the starting address of the next instruction in memory.

For example, if the current instruction is located at memory address 0x1000, the PC would be updated to 0x1002 after the instruction is executed. The next instruction can then be fetched from memory starting at address 0x1002.

This process of incrementing the PC by the size of the instruction ensures that the CPU can continuously fetch and execute instructions in the correct sequence, as specified by the program.

### What happens after the PC is incremented?

After the PC is incremented, it points to the starting address of the next instruction. The process of fetching an instruction, executing it, and updating the PC is repeated continuously until the program terminates.

### Can the increment value be changed dynamically?

In some architectures, the increment value can be changed dynamically based on the outcome of an instruction, allowing for branching and looping constructs.

### How does the PC update when the increment value changes dynamically?

In such cases, the PC can be updated to point to a different location in memory, allowing the program to branch to a different section of code or repeat a section of code multiple times.

Here's an example of how the increment value of the Program Counter (PC) can be changed dynamically based on the outcome of an instruction:

Suppose you have the following code in a simple assembly language:
```ruby
Loop:
   ; Perform some task
   cmp result, 0
   je End
   jmp Loop
End:
```
In this code, the loop performs some task and then compares the result of that task to 0 using the `cmp` (compare) instruction. If the result is equal to 0, the loop branches to the end using the `je` (jump if equal) instruction. If the result is not equal to 0, the loop jumps back to the beginning of the loop using the `jmp` (jump) instruction.

In this example, the increment value of the PC is changed dynamically based on the outcome of the `cmp` instruction. If the result is equal to 0, the PC is updated to point to a different location in memory (the `End` label), allowing the program to branch to a different section of code. If the result is not equal to 0, the PC is updated to jump back to the beginning of the loop, allowing the program to repeat the same section of code multiple times.

This ability to change the increment value of the PC dynamically based on the outcome of an instruction is what allows for branching and looping constructs in computer programs. It enables the CPU to execute different parts of the program based on the results of computation, making it possible to write complex and flexible software.

q; what's the internel reigster file?
a; contains 16 registers, storing 64-bit values that can hold addresses or integer data

q; what do the condition code registers hold?

The Condition Code Registers, also known as the Flags Register, holds status information about the results of the most recently executed arithmetic or logical instructions. This information is used by certain instructions to determine the flow of a program.

For example, consider the following instruction:

`CMP AX, BX`

This instruction compares the values stored in the AX and BX registers and sets the flags in the Condition Code Register accordingly. If the value in AX is equal to the value in BX, the Zero Flag (ZF) is set to 1. If the value in AX is greater than the value in BX, the Carry Flag (CF) is set to 0 and the Sign Flag (SF) is set to 0. Conversely, if the value in AX is less than the value in BX, the Carry Flag is set to 1 and the Sign Flag is set to 1.

These flags can then be tested by branch instructions, such as JE (jump if equal) or JG (jump if greater), to determine the flow of the program based on the result of the comparison.

q; what flag do you input to make the compiler generate an assembly file?
a; -S

q; in an assembly file, there are lines like ```.file	"010â€“mstore.c"```. What does the . mean?
a; it's a directive to guide the assembler and linker, but we shouldn't focus on them at the moment

q; what's the effective address?
a;
An effective address is the final address that is used to access a **memory location** in a computer's memory. It is the result of applying an addressing mode to a memory operand, which specifies how the address of the operand is calculated.

Effective addresses can be calculated using various addressing modes, such as:

-   Immediate addressing: the operand is a constant value, stored in the instruction itself.
movl $42, %eax    # Move the immediate value 42 into the EAX register

In this example, the immediate value 42 is directly specified in the instruction itself using the `$` prefix to indicate an immediate value. This addressing mode is called "immediate" because the operand is immediately available in the instruction.

-   Register addressing: the operand is stored in a register.
movl %ecx, %eax   # Move the contents of ECX into the EAX register

-   Direct addressing: the operand's memory address is stored in the instruction.
movl data, %eax   # Move the contents of the memory location "data" into the EAX register

In this example, the memory address of the operand is stored in the instruction itself, in this case the label "data". This addressing mode is called "direct" because the memory address is directly specified in the instruction.

-   Indirect addressing: the operand's memory address is stored in a register or memory location pointed to by another register.
movl (%ebx), %eax # Move the contents of the memory location pointed to by the EBX register into the EAX register

In this example, the memory address of the operand is stored in a register, in this case the EBX register, or in a memory location pointed to by another register. This addressing mode is called "indirect" because the memory address is indirectly specified through a register.
-   Indexed addressing: the operand's memory address is calculated by adding an index value to a base address.

```c
movl some_array(,%ecx,4), %eax   # Move the contents of the memory location at the base address "some_array + (ECX * 4)" into the EAX register
`some_array` is the base address, `%ecx` is the index value, and `4` is the scale factor for the index. The parentheses around `%ecx,4` indicate that this is an indexed addressing mode.
```

The x86-64 instruction set has many different addressing modes that can be used to calculate effective addresses. Each addressing mode has its own specific syntax, and the choice of addressing mode used can affect the code size, performance and the possibility of exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

In general, effective address is the final address that is used to access a memory location, that can be calculated using different addressing modes, each one of them has its own benefits and drawbacks.

mov eax, [ebx + 4*ecx + 2]

In this example, the instruction is moving the value from the memory location into the register `eax`. The memory operand is `[ebx + 4*ecx + 2]`. This is an example of indexed addressing mode, where the effective address is calculated by adding an index value to a base address.

The base address is stored in the `ebx` register. The index value is stored in the `ecx` register and it's multiplied by 4, which is the scale factor. And finally, the offset is 2.

The effective address is calculated by adding the base address (stored in `ebx`) to the result of the index value (stored in `ecx`) multiplied by the scale factor (4) and the offset (2).

So the effective address is: `ebx + 4*ecx + 2`.

This instruction loads the value stored at the memory location pointed by `ebx + 4*ecx + 2` into the `eax` register.

It's important to note that when using indexed addressing mode, the values of the base, index, scale and offset are not fixed, they can change during the execution of the program and it can lead to unexpected results if the values are not set properly.
#### Practice problem 3.1
%rax is 100
%rdx - 0x3

q; what does 4(%rax) do?
a; it refers to the val of the address 104

#### q; what does 9(%rax,%rdx) do?
a; 
The expression `9(%rax,%rdx)` is called an indexed addressing mode. It specifies that the memory address being accessed is calculated by adding a base value to an index value, and then adding an optional displacement. In this case, the base value is the contents of the `%rax` register, the index value is the contents of the `%rdx` register, and the displacement is 9.

So the memory address being accessed is calculated as follows:

`memory_address = 9 + %rax + %rdx`

In this example, `%rax` has the value 0x100 and `%rdx` has the value 0x3, so the memory address being accessed is:

`memory_address = 9 + 0x100 + 0x3 memory_address = 0x10c`

Therefore, the expression `9(%rax,%rdx)` accesses the memory address 0x10c, which has a value of 0x11 in the table.

q: how is memory_address = 9 + 0x100 + 0x3 -> 0x10c?
In this example, the values 0x9, 0x100, and 0x3 are all hexadecimal (base 16) numbers. In hexadecimal notation, each digit can have 16 possible values, from 0 to 15, represented by the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F.

To add hexadecimal numbers, you follow the same rules as for decimal (base 10) numbers, except that you use base 16 instead of base 10. Here's how the calculation would look if we wrote the numbers in decimal notation:

`memory_address = 9 + 256 + 3 
memory_address = 268`

Since the numbers are in hexadecimal notation, we need to convert the result (268) back to hexadecimal. To do this, we divide the result by 16 and take the remainder as the least significant digit. Then we repeat the process with the quotient, until the quotient is 0.

```c
268 / 16 = 16 remainder 12
16 / 16 = 1 remainder 0
1 / 16 = 0 remainder 1
```
The hexadecimal representation of 268 is therefore `0x10c`.

#### 0xFC(,%rcx,4)
In this example, `%rcx` has the value 0x1, so the memory address being accessed is:
```c
memory_address = 0xFC + 0 + 0x1
memory_address = 0xFD
```
However, the index value is multiplied by the scale factor, which in this case is 4. This means that the index value is actually multiplied by 4 before it is added to the base value and displacement. So the actual memory address being accessed is:

```c
memory_address = 0xFC + 0 + 4*0x1
memory_address = 0xFC + 0 + 0x4
memory_address = 0x100
```
Therefore, the expression `0xFC(,%rcx,4)` accesses the memory address 0x100, which has a value of 0xFF in the table.

#### `(%rax,%rdx,4)`
```c
memory_address = 0 + 0x100 + 4*0x3
memory_address = 0x100 + 0xC
memory_address = 0x10C
```
