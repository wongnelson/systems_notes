- C provides two mechanisms for creating data types by combining objects of different types: _structures_, declared using the keyword `struct`, aggregate multiple objects into a single unit; _unions_, declared using the keyword `union`, allow an object to be referenced using several different types
- The C `struct` declaration creates a data type that groups objects of possibly different types into a single object
 - all of the components of a structure are stored in a contiguous region of memory and a pointer to a structure is the address of its first byte
 - The compiler maintains information about each structure type indicating the byte offset of each field. It generates references to structure elements using these offsets as displacements in memory referencing instructions.

 -   This problem gets you to think about structure layout and the code used to access structure fields. The structure declaration is a variant of the example shown in the text. It shows that nested structures are allocated by embedding the inner structures within the outer ones.

	Consider the following structure declaration:

```c
struct prob {
	int *p;
	struct {
	  int x;
	  int y;
	} s;
	struct prob *next;
};
```

This declaration illustrates that one structure can be embedded within another, just as arrays can be embedded within structures and arrays can be embedded within arrays.

The following procedure (with some expressions omitted) operates on this structure:

```

void sp_init(struct prob *sp) {
	sp->s.x =	__________;
	sp->p =		__________;
	sp->next=	__________;
}
```


q: What are the offsets (in bytes) of the following fields?
    1.  The layout of the structure is as follows:

q:  How many total bytes does the structure require?
    2.  It uses 24 bytes.

q: On the basis of this information, fill in the missing expressions in the code for `sp_init.`
a: 
	The compiler generates the following assembly code for `sp_init:`
        
        ```c
		
        	void sp_init(struct prob *sp)
        	sp in %rdi
        1	sp_init:
        2	  movl	12(%rdi), %eax	Get sp->s.y
        3	  movl	%eax, 8(%rdi)	Save in sp->s.x
        4	  leaq	8(%rdi), %rax	Compute &(sp->s.x)
        5	  movq	%rax, (%rdi)	Store in sp->p
        6	  movq	%rdi, 16(%rdi)	Store sp in sp->next
        7	  ret
        ```
        
        From this, we can generate C code as follows:
        
        ```
        
        void sp_init(struct prob *sp)
        {
        	sp->s.x	= sp->s.y;
        	sp->p	= &(sp->s.x);
        	sp->next	= sp;
        }
        ```

#### 3.42
The following code shows the declaration of a structure of type `ELE` and the prototype for a function `fun`:

```c

struct ELE {
	long v;
	struct ELE *p;
};

long fun(struct ELE *ptr);
```

When the code for `fun` is compiled, gcc generates the following assembly code:

```c

	long fun(struct ELE *ptr)
	ptr in %rdi
1	fun:
2	movl	$0, %eax
3	jmp	.L2
4	L3:
5	addq	(%rdi), %rax
6	movq	8(%rdi), %rdi
7	.L2:
8	testq	%rdi, %rdi
9	jne	.L3
10	rep; ret
```

-   This problem demonstrates how a very common data structure and operation on it is implemented in machine code. We solve the problem by first annotating the assembly code, recognizing that the two fields of the structure are at offsets 0 (for `v`) and 8 (for `p`).
    
    ```c
    
    	long fun(struct ELE *ptr)
    	ptr in %rdi
    1	fun:
    2	  movl	$0, %eax	result = 0
    3	  jmp	.L2		Goto middle
    4	.L3:		    loop:
    5	  addq	(%rdi), %rax	result += ptr->v
    6	  movq	8(%rdi), %rdi	ptr = ptr->p
    7	.L2:		    middle:
    8	  testq	%rdi, %rdi	Test ptr
    9	  jne	.L3		If ! = NULL, goto loop
    10	  rep;	ret
    ```
    
    1.  Based on the annotated code, we can generate a C version:
        
        ```c
        
        long fun(struct ELE *ptr) {
        	long val = 0;
        	while (ptr) {
        	  val += ptr->v;
        	  ptr = ptr->p;
        	}
        	return val;
        }
        ```
        
    2.  We can see that each structure is an element in a singly linked list, with field `v` being the value of the element and `p` being a pointer to the next element. Function fun computes the sum of the element values in the list.
