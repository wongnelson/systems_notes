**q; what are XMM registers used for?**
a;  passing floating-point arguments to functions and for returning floating-point values from them

**q; how many floating point arguments can be passed in XMM registers? why?**
a; 8 - %xmm0-%xmm7
The XMM registers in x86-64 architecture are specialized registers designed for efficient floating-point operations. They are 128-bits wide and can hold two double-precision floating-point numbers or four single-precision floating-point numbers.

The first eight floating-point arguments can be passed in XMM0 to XMM7 in the x86-64 architecture. The reason for this is because the number of XMM registers is limited, and some are reserved for specific purposes, such as holding data or intermediate results. So, only a limited number of XMM registers are available for passing floating-point arguments.

When a function with floating-point arguments is called, the first eight floating-point arguments are passed in XMM0 to XMM7. Any additional floating-point arguments would need to be passed on the stack. This is why the number of floating-point arguments that can be passed in XMM registers is limited to eight.

In conclusion, the XMM registers are designed to hold floating-point numbers efficiently, but due to the limited number of XMM registers available and the size of the floating-point numbers they can hold, only the first eight floating-point arguments can be passed in XMM0 to XMM7. Any additional floating-point arguments would need to be passed on the stack.


**q; which register is used to return floats from functions and why?**
a; 
x86-64 ABI specifies that floating-point values should be returned in the xmm0 register for compatibility and consistency across different libraries and applications. This convention helps ensure that functions that return floating-point values follow a standardized, predictable behavior, making it easier for developers to write and maintain code. The use of xmm0 for returning floating-point values is just one aspect of the ABI, which defines a number of other conventions, such as calling conventions and data representation, to ensure that code written in different languages or compiled by different compilers can work together seamlessly.

q;  All XMM registers are caller saved. The callee may overwrite any of these registers without first saving it. why?
a; The XMM registers in the x86-64 architecture are considered "caller saved," meaning that it is the responsibility of the calling function (the "caller") to save and restore any values stored in these registers. This is in contrast to "callee saved" registers, where the called function (the "callee") is responsible for preserving the values stored in these registers across function calls.

The reason why the XMM registers are caller saved is to improve performance by allowing the callee to freely modify these registers without the overhead of saving and restoring their values. Since floating-point calculations are typically performed in separate units (such as the SSE or AVX units), saving and restoring the values stored in the XMM registers can be an expensive operation. By allowing the callee to overwrite these registers, the compiler can generate more efficient code that avoids the need to save and restore the values stored in these registers.

However, this means that the caller must take care to save and restore the values stored in the XMM registers if they need to be preserved across function calls. The use of caller-saved and callee-saved registers is part of the ABI for the x86-64 architecture, which defines a number of conventions for how functions should interact with the register set. The use of caller-saved XMM registers is just one aspect of the ABI, which defines a number of other conventions, such as calling conventions and data representation, to ensure that code written in different languages or compiled by different compilers can work together seamlessly.

-   The basic rules for mapping arguments to registers are fairly simple (although they become much more complex with more and other types of argument)
    
    1.  `double g1(double a, long b, float c, int d);`
        
        Registers: `a` in `%xmm0, b` in `%rdi c` in `%xmm1, d` in `%esi`
        
    2.  `double g2(int a, double *b, float *c, long d);`
        
        Registers: `a` in `%edi, b` in `%rsi, c` in `%rdx, d` in `%rcx`
        
    3.  `double g3(double *a, double b, int c, float d);`
        
        Registers: `a` in `%rdi, b` in `%xmm0, c` in `%esi, d` in `%xmm1`
        
    4.  `double g4(float a, int *b, float c, double d);`
        
        Registers: `a` in `%xmm0, b` in `%rdi, c` in `%xmm1, d` in `%xmm2`
