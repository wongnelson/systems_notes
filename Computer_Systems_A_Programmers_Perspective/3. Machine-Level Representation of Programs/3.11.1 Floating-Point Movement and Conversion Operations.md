q; what are scalar instructions?
a; instructions that reference memory, meaning that they operate on individual, rather than packed, data values. The data are held either in memory, or in XMM registers

Scalar instructions that reference memory include data movement instructions such as "mov", "lea" (load effective address), "xchg" (exchange) etc, which move data between registers or between a register and memory. These instructions can be used to load a single value from memory into a register, store a single value from a register to memory, or move data between registers.

Also, scalar instructions can be used for arithmetic operations such as "add", "sub", "mul", "div" etc, which perform mathematical operations on individual data values. These instructions can be used to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two values and store the result in a destination register or memory location.

Scalar instructions can also be used for logical operations such as "and", "or", "xor" etc, which perform bitwise operations on individual data values. These instructions can be used to perform operations such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT on two operands and store the result in a destination register or memory location.

q; what are examples of individual and packed data values?
a; "Individual data values" refer to single data elements, such as a single integer, a single floating-point number, or a single character. These values can be stored in a single memory location or register, and can be manipulated by scalar instructions.

For example, consider the following C code:
```c
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int c = a + b;
```
In this example, the variables "a", "b", and "c" are individual data values, each storing a single integer. The scalar instruction "add" can be used to add the values of "a" and "b" and store the result in "c".


"Packed data values" refer to multiple data values that are stored in a single register or memory location. These values are typically used in SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, which can perform the same operation on multiple data values simultaneously.

For example, consider the following C code:
```c
__m128 a = _mm_set_ps(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f);
__m128 b = _mm_set_ps(5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f);
__m128 c = _mm_add_ps(a, b);
```
Here, the variables "a", "b", and "c" are packed data values, each storing four single-precision floating-point numbers. The instruction _mm_add_ps is a SIMD instruction that can add the values of "a" and "b" and store the result in "c" simultaneously.

In summary, individual data values are single data elements, such as a single integer, a single floating-point number, or a single character, that can be stored in a single memory location or register and manipulated by scalar instructions. Packed data values are multiple data values that are stored in a single register or memory location, which are typically used in SIMD instructions.

- Memory references are specified in the same way as for the integer mov instructions, with all of the different possible combinations of displacement, base register, index register, and scaling factor.

q; why does vmovss and vmovaps not require alignment. explain in detail
a; vmovss and vmovaps are instructions used in x86 assembly language for moving data between registers and memory. They are part of the AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) instruction set, which is an extension to the SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) instruction set.

One of the main advantages of AVX over SSE is that it allows for more efficient handling of unaligned memory accesses. This is because AVX instructions can operate on 256-bit wide registers, which are larger than the 128-bit wide registers used by SSE instructions.

Because of this larger register size, AVX instructions can access more data with a single instruction, even if that data is not aligned to a 128-bit boundary. This allows them to avoid the penalty of having to perform multiple memory accesses to load or store the data, as would be the case with SSE instructions.

Furthermore, the AVX instruction set also include vmovntdqa instruction, which is used to store data to memory using non-temporal hints, which can help avoid cache pollution and improve performance.


q; how does GCC transfer data from memory to an XMM register or from an XMM register to memory? 
a; using scalar movement operations only

q; how does GCC transfer data between two XMM registers?
a;  it uses one of two different instructions for copying the entire contents of one XMM register to another—namely, `vmovaps` for single-precision and `vmovapd` for double-precision values. For these cases, whether the program copies the entire register or just the low-order value affects neither the program functionality nor the execution speed, and so using these instructions rather than ones specific to scalar data makes no real difference

q; For transferring between two registers, there is no possibility of an incorrect alignment. why?
a; When transferring data between two registers within the same processor, there is no possibility of an incorrect memory alignment. This is because the data is being stored within the processor's internal register file, which is managed by the processor itself.

In this case, the processor can manipulate the data stored in the register file as it sees fit, regardless of whether the data is aligned to specific memory boundaries or not. This is because the processor has complete control over the memory addresses used by the register file, and can access the data stored in the register file with a single cycle of the processor's clock.

Therefore, when transferring data between two registers, the processor can perform the transfer regardless of the alignment of the data, and without incurring any performance penalties associated with unaligned memory accesses.

Additionally, transferring data between two registers is a relatively simple operation that can be performed quickly and with low overhead, since the data does not need to be transferred to or from main memory. This makes it a fast and efficient way to manipulate data within the processor.

#### Alignment
Scalar instructions, such as `vmovss`, operate on individual data values, rather than packed data values. This means that they only operate on one value at a time, rather than multiple values packed together.

As a result of this, scalar instructions do not have the same alignment requirements as instructions that operate on packed data values. Instructions that operate on packed data values, such as `movaps` in x86 architecture, require that the memory location be aligned on a specific boundary. This is because the instruction is designed to read or write multiple values at once, so the data must be arranged in a specific way in memory to ensure that all the values can be read or written correctly.

On the other hand, scalar instructions like `vmovss` do not have this requirement as they only operate on one value at a time. Since it only move one value, it does not need to be arranged in a specific way in memory and does not require specific alignment.

In summary, Scalar instructions, like `vmovss` operate on individual data values, rather than packed data values, so they don't have the same alignment requirements as instructions that operate on packed data values. Instructions that operate on packed data values require that the memory location be aligned on a specific boundary, while scalar instructions don't have this requirement.

##### Examples
Here are a few examples of scalar instructions and packed instructions in x86 assembly and their corresponding alignment requirements:

Scalar instruction:
`mov eax, [ebx]` 

This instruction moves a 4-byte value from memory location pointed by the register ebx to the register eax. This instruction does not require any specific alignment for the memory location because it only reads one 4-byte value at a time.

Packed instruction:
`movaps xmm0, [ebx]`

This instruction moves a packed value of 4 single-precision floating-point values from memory location pointed by the register ebx to the register xmm0. This instruction requires that the memory location pointed by the ebx to be aligned on a 16-byte boundary. This is because the instruction is designed to read 4 single-precision floating-point values at once, so the data must be arranged in a specific way in memory to ensure that all 4 values can be read correctly. If the memory location is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, it can result in incorrect data being read or a crash.

Another example:
`vmovss xmm0, [ebx]`

This instruction moves a single-precision floating-point value from memory location pointed by the register ebx to the register xmm0. This instruction does not require any specific alignment for the memory location because it only reads one single-precision floating-point value at a time.

In these examples, the scalar instruction `mov eax, [ebx]` and packed instruction `vmovss xmm0, [ebx]` do not have any alignment requirement because they only read one value at a time, while the packed instruction `movaps xmm0, [ebx]` requires that the memory location must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary. This is because `movaps` reads 4 single-precision floating-point values at once, so the data must be arranged in a specific way in memory to ensure that all 4 values can be read correctly.

It's worth noting that, when you try to access unaligned memory location with a packed instruction, it can result in a crash or incorrect results because the instruction is not designed to read unaligned data, while scalar instructions and architecture with unaligned memory access support, can handle it without any problem.

C function

```c
float float_mov(float v1, float *src, float *dst) {
	float v2 = *src;
	*dst = v1;
	return v2;
}
```

ASM:
```c
	float float_mov(float v1, float *src, float *dst)
	v1 in %xmm0, src in %rdi, dst in %rsi
1	float_mov:
2	vmovaps	%xmm0, %xmm1	Copy v1
3	vmovss	(%rdi), %xmm0	Read v2 from src
4	vmovss	%xmm1, (%rsi)	Write v1 to dst
5	ret			Return v2 in %xmm
```

Observations:
- v1 isn't at rdi, but is at xmm0 instead
- 2) copy v1 to v2 register to register directly
- 3) move to xmm0 because it's not used anymore

q: why don't we have to use rax in this case? 
a; In this case, we don't need to use the `%rax` register because the function is returning a single-precision floating-point value, which can be stored in an XMM register.

In x86_64 architecture, XMM registers can be used to store single-precision and double-precision floating-point values, as well as integer values, in a manner that is more efficient than using general-purpose registers. This is because XMM registers are specifically designed to perform floating-point and vector operations, and they are capable of handling a larger data type compared to general-purpose registers.

So in this case, we can use the XMM register `%xmm0` to store the return value (`v2`), which is a single-precision floating-point value, and return it directly to the caller without having to transfer it to the `%rax` register. This allows us to take advantage of the performance benefits of using XMM registers for floating-point values and also reduces the amount of register-to-register transfers required in the function.

q; where does the calling function get the return value?
a; The return value of the function is stored in the XMM register `%xmm0` and can be accessed directly by the caller using the XMM register.

For example, if the function `float_mov` is called from another function, the return value can be accessed by simply using the `%xmm0` register in the calling function. No additional load or store instructions are required to transfer the return value from the XMM register to another register or memory location.

### Convert int to float

q; what is this inst doing "vcvtsi2sdq %rax, %xmm1, %xmm1"
a; `vcvtsi2sdq %rax, %xmm1, %xmm1` is an instruction in x86 assembly language, and its purpose is to convert an integer value stored in the `%rax` register into a double-precision floating-point value and store the result in the `%xmm1` register.

Here's how it works:

-   The first operand, `%rax`, is the source register that holds the integer value to be converted.
    
-   The second operand, `%xmm1`, is the destination register that will store the result of the conversion.
    
-   The third operand, also `%xmm1`, is a source register that is used as a temporary register to hold the intermediate result of the conversion.

movl	$42, %eax
vcvtsi2sdq	%rax, %xmm1, %xmm1

`vcvtsi2sdq %rax, %xmm1, %xmm1` is an instruction in x86 assembly language, and its purpose is to convert an integer value stored in the `%rax` register into a double-precision floating-point value and store the result in the `%xmm1` register.

Here's how it works:

-   The first operand, `%rax`, is the source register that holds the integer value to be converted.
    
-   The second operand, `%xmm1`, is the destination register that will store the result of the conversion.
    
-   The third operand, also `%xmm1`, is a source register that is used as a temporary register to hold the intermediate result of the conversion.
    

Here's an example to help illustrate the use of this instruction:

`movl	$42, %eax vcvtsi2sdq	%rax, %xmm1, %xmm1`

In this example, the integer value 42 is stored in the `%eax` register using the `movl` instruction. Then, the `vcvtsi2sdq` instruction is used to convert this integer value into a double-precision floating-point value and store the result in the `%xmm1` register.

In the `vcvtsi2sdq` instruction, the `%rax` operand is used as the source register to hold the integer value, the first `%xmm1` operand is used as the destination register to hold the result, and the second `%xmm1` operand is used as a temporary register.

q; why do you need the temp register?
a; The temporary register is used in the `vcvtsi2sdq` instruction to hold the intermediate result of the conversion, before it is stored in the destination register.

This is done to ensure that the original value stored in the destination register is not overwritten or lost during the conversion process. It also allows for additional operations to be performed on the intermediate result before it is stored in the final destination register.

In this way, the use of a temporary register helps ensure the accuracy and consistency of the computation, as well as preserving the original values stored in the other registers.

q: so we're using xmm1 as the temporary and destination register at the same time? how does that work?
a; Yes, in the `vcvtsi2sdq %rax, %xmm1, %xmm1` instruction, `xmm1` is used as both the temporary and destination register. The purpose of this is to save an additional register, since many instructions only operate on a limited number of registers.

The instruction performs the following steps:

1.  It converts the integer stored in the `%rax` register to a double-precision floating-point value.
2.  It stores the result of the conversion in the `%xmm1` register.

The value stored in the `%xmm1` register is overwritten with the result of the conversion, but this is not a problem since the original value is no longer needed after the conversion is complete. This way, the instruction saves an additional register, which would have been used if a separate destination register was specified.

As an example of the different floating-point conversion operations, consider the C function

```c

double fcvt(int i, float *fp, double *dp, long *lp)
{
	float f = *fp; double d = *dp; long l = *lp;
	*lp = (long) d;
	*fp = (float) i;
	*dp = (double) l;
	return (double) f;
}
```

and its associated x86-64 assembly code

```c

	double fcvt(int i, float *fp, double *dp, long *lp)
	i in %edi, fp in %rsi, dp in %rdx, lp in %rcx
1	fcvt:
2	 vmovss	(%rsi), %xmm0			Get f = *fp
3	 movq	(%rcx), %rax			Get l = *lp
4	 vcvttsd2siq	(%rdx), %r8		Get d = *dp and convert to long
5	 movq	%r8, (%rcx)			Store at lp
6	 vcvtsi2ss	%edi, %xmm1, %xmm1	Convert i to float
7	 vmovss	%xmm1, (%rsi)			Store at fp
8	 vcvtsi2sdq	%rax, %xmm1, %xmm1	Convert l to double
9	 vmovsd	%xmm1, (%rdx)			Store at dp
	The following two instructions convert f to double
10	 vunpcklps	%xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0
11	 vcvtps2pd	%xmm0, %xmm0
12	 ret					Return f
```

q; Why does "vcvttsd2siq (%rdx), %r8", storing at \*dp take precedence over the other store, like \*lp = (long) d;
a; The reason is that the instruction "vcvttsd2siq (%rdx), %r8" performs both the load from the double pointer and the conversion from double to long, so it takes precedence over the subsequent store to the long pointer. This is because the instruction combines multiple operations into a single instruction, making it more efficient.

q; movq (%rcx), %rax, why are we storing it to rax?
a; The instruction "movq (%rcx), %rax" loads the value at the memory location pointed to by %rcx into the register %rax. The purpose of this instruction is to retrieve the value stored at the long pointer "lp" and prepare it for use in subsequent operations. The choice of %rax as the destination register is arbitrary and determined by the compiler or programmer.

q; what is line 10 and 11 doing?
a; Line 10: "vunpcklps %xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0"

This instruction performs a "Unpack and Interleave Low Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values" operation on the register %xmm0, which holds the value of "f". The instruction duplicates the contents of %xmm0 into two separate single-precision floating-point values within the register, effectively making %xmm0 a packed single-precision floating-point value with two identical elements.

Line 11: "vcvtps2pd %xmm0, %xmm0"

This instruction performs a "Convert Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values to Packed Double-Precision Floating-Point Values" operation on the register %xmm0, which now holds a packed single-precision floating-point value with two identical elements. The instruction converts these two single-precision floating-point values to two double-precision floating-point values, which are then stored back in %xmm0 as a packed double-precision floating-point value.

Together, these two instructions convert the single-precision floating-point value "f" to a double-precision floating-point value, which is then returned as the result of the function.

#### 3.50
1.  For the following C code, the expressions `val1-val4` all map to the program values `i, f, d`, and `l`:
    
    ```c
    
    double fcvt2(int *ip, float *fp, double *dp, long l)
    {
    	int i = *ip; float f = *fp; double d = *dp;
    	*ip = (int)	val1;
    	*fp = (float)	val2;
    	*dp = (double)	val3;
    	return (double)	val4;
    }
    ```
    
    Determine the mapping, based on the following x86-64 code for the function:
    
    ```c
    
    	double fcvt2(int *ip, float *fp, double *dp, long l) ip in %rdi, fp in %rsi, dp in %rdx, l in %rcx Result returned in %xmm0
    1	fcvt2:
    2	 movl	(%rdi), %eax
    3	 vmovss	(%rsi), %xmm0
    4	 vcvttsd2si	(%rdx), %r8d
    5	 movl %r8d,	(%rdi)
    6	 vcvtsi2ss	%eax, %xmm1, %xmm1
    7	 vmovss %xmm1,	(%rsi)
    8	 vcvtsi2sdq	%rcx, %xmm1, %xmm1
    9	 vmovsd	%xmm1, (%rdx)
    10	 vunpcklps	%xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0
    11	 vcvtps2pd	%xmm0, %xmm0
    12	 ret
    ```
-   The value at `dp` is retrieved, converted to an `int` (line 4), and then stored at `ip`. We can therefore infer that `val1` is `d`.
    To infer that `val1` is `d`, you need to look at the assembly code that operates on `ip` and `dp`. Here is a step-by-step process with more detail:

1.  In the C code, the first assignment statement is `*ip = (int) val1`. This means that the value of `val1` is being cast to an `int` and then stored at the memory location pointed to by `ip`.
    
2.  In the x86-64 code, the first instruction that operates on `ip` is `movl (%rdi), %eax`. This instruction loads the value at the memory location pointed to by `rdi` (which is equivalent to `ip`) into the `eax` register.
    
3.  The next instruction that operates on `dp` is `vcvttsd2si (%rdx), %r8d`. This instruction is a conversion instruction that takes the value pointed to by `rdx` (which is equivalent to `dp`), converts it to an `int`, and stores the result in the `r8d` register.
    
4.  The next instruction is `movl %r8d, (%rdi)`, which stores the `int` in `r8d` at the memory location pointed to by `rdi` (which is equivalent to `ip`).
    

Based on the sequence of instructions, it can be inferred that `val1` is `d` because `d` is being converted to an `int` and stored at the memory location pointed to by `ip`.

-   The value at `ip` is retrieved, converted to a `float` (line 6), and then stored at `fp`. We can therefore infer that `val2` is `i`.
To infer that `val2` is `i`, you need to look at the assembly code that operates on `fp` and `ip`. Here is a step-by-step process with more detail:

1.  In the C code, the second assignment statement is `*fp = (float) val2`. This means that the value of `val2` is being cast to a `float` and then stored at the memory location pointed to by `fp`.
    To infer that `val1` is `d`, you need to look at the assembly code that operates on `ip` and `dp`. Here is a step-by-step process with more detail:

1.  In the C code, the first assignment statement is `*ip = (int) val1`. This means that the value of `val1` is being cast to an `int` and then stored at the memory location pointed to by `ip`.
    
2.  In the x86-64 code, the first instruction that operates on `ip` is `movl (%rdi), %eax`. This instruction loads the value at the memory location pointed to by `rdi` (which is equivalent to `ip`) into the `eax` register.
    
3.  The next instruction that operates on `dp` is `vcvttsd2si (%rdx), %r8d`. This instruction is a conversion instruction that takes the value pointed to by `rdx` (which is equivalent to `dp`), converts it to an `int`, and stores the result in the `r8d` register.
    
4.  The next instruction is `movl %r8d, (%rdi)`, which stores the `int` in `r8d` at the memory location pointed to by `rdi` (which is equivalent to `ip`).
    

Based on the sequence of instructions, it can be inferred that `val1` is `d` because `d` is being converted to an `int` and stored at the memory location pointed to by `ip`.
2.  In the x86-64 code, the first instruction that operates on `ip` is `movl (%rdi), %eax`. This instruction loads the value at the memory location pointed to by `rdi` (which is equivalent to `ip`) into the `eax` register.
    
3.  The next instruction that operates on `fp` is `vmovss (%rsi), %xmm0`. This instruction loads the value at the memory location pointed to by `rsi` (which is equivalent to `fp`) into the `xmm0` register.
    
4.  The next instruction is `vcvtsi2ss %eax, %xmm1, %xmm1`, which converts the `int` in `eax` to a `float` and stores the result in the `xmm1` register.
    
5.  The next instruction is `vmovss %xmm1, (%rsi)`, which stores the `float` in `xmm1` at the memory location pointed to by `rsi` (which is equivalent to `fp`).
    

Based on the sequence of instructions, it can be inferred that `val2` is `i` because `i` is being converted to a `float` and stored at the memory location pointed to by `fp`.
    
-   The value of `l` is converted to a `double` (line 8) and stored at `dp`. We can therefore infer that `val3` is `l`
The steps and clues to infer that `val3` is `l` are as follows:

1.  In the function, `l` is passed as an argument and stored in the `%rcx` register.
2.  On line 8, the `%rcx` register, which holds `l`, is converted to a double-precision floating-point number using the `vcvtsi2sdq` instruction.
3.  The result of the conversion is stored in the `%xmm1` register.
4.  Finally, the value stored in the `%xmm1` register is stored back into the location pointed to by `dp`, which was passed as an argument to the function, using the `vmovsd` instruction (line 9).

Based on these steps, we can conclude that `val3` is `l`.
    
-   The value at `fp` is retrieved on line 3. The two instructions at lines 10-11 convert this to double precision as the value returned in register `%xmm0`. We can therefore infer that `val4` is `f`.
The steps and clues to infer that `val4` is `f` are as follows:

1.  In the function, `f` is passed as an argument and stored in the `%rsi` register.
2.  On line 3, the value stored at the location pointed to by `fp` (which is `f`) is loaded into the `%xmm0` register using the `vmovss` instruction.
3.  The value stored in the `%xmm0` register is then unpacked using the `vunpcklps` instruction (line 10) and converted to double-precision using the `vcvtps2pd` instruction (line 11).
4.  Finally, the value stored in the `%xmm0` register is returned by the function as the result.

Based on these steps, we can conclude that `val4` is `f`.

#### 3.51
The following C function converts an argument of type `src_t` to a return value of type `dest_t`, where these two types are defined using `typedef`:

```c

dest_t cvt(src_t x)
{
	dest_t y = (dest_t) x;
	return y;

```

For execution on x86-64, assume that argument `x` is either in `%xmm0` or in the appropriately named portion of register `%rdi` (i.e., `%rdi` or `%edi`). One or two instructions are to be used to perform the type conversion and to copy the value to the appropriately named portion of register `%rax` (integer result) or `%xmm0` (floating-point result). Show the instruction(s), including the source and destination registers.
