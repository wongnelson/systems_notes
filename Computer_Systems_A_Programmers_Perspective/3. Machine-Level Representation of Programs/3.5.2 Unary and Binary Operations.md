q; what's a unary operation?
a; A unary operation is an operation that takes a single operand. In assembly, a unary operation is typically used to manipulate the value stored in a single register or memory location.

`inc %eax`  - this is an unary operation that increments the value stored in the %eax register by 1. The %eax register is both the source and the destination of the operation. The instruction reads the value stored in %eax, increments it by 1, and then writes the result back to %eax.

the instruction `incq (%rsp)` causes the 8-byte element on the top of the stack to be incremented


Problem 3.8
![[image-20230114170714886.png]]

1) `addq %rcx,(%rax)`
- we are adding the value of %rcx to the value of the memory lcoation of %rax
	respectively, this is 0x1 and 0xFF
- 0xFF is represented in hexadecimal notation and it equivalent to 255 in decimal representation, 0x1 is also represented in hexadecimal notation and it equivalent to 1 in decimal representation. When we add 0xFF and 0x1 in decimal representation, we get 255 + 1 = 256.

When we convert the result 256 to hexadecimal representation, we get 0x100.

So, 0xFF + 0x1 = 0x100 in hexadecimal representation.

2) `subq %rdx,8(%rax)`
operation 0xAB - 0x3 = 0xA8:
1.  Convert the hexadecimal values to decimal representation: 0xAB = 171, 0x3 = 3
2.  Perform the subtraction operation: 171 - 3 = 168
3.  Convert the result to hexadecimal representation: 168 = 0xA8

So, the final result is 0xA8

It's worth noting that the subtraction operation is performed in decimal representation then the result is converted to hexadecimal representation.
