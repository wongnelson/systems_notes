q; what does the `ret` inst do?
a; an instruction that transfers control to the return address located on the stack. This address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction. Upon execution, the RET instruction pops the return address off the stack (which is pointed to by the stack pointer register) and then continues execution at that address. This allows programs to call and return from subroutines. It is also used to return from interrupt handlers.

q; what's the `call` inst target?
a; The `call` instruction has a target indicating the address of the instruction where the called procedure start

The disassembled code for two functions `first` and `last` is shown below, along with the code for a call of `first` by function `main`:

```c

	Disassembly of last(long u, long v)
	u in %rdi, v in %rsi
1	0000000000400540 <last>:
2	400540: 48 89 f8		mov		%rdi,%rax		L1: u
3	400543: 48 0f af c6		imul		%rsi,%rax		L2: u*v
4	400547: c3			retq					L3: Return
	Disassembly of last(long x)
	x in %rdi
5	0000000000400548 <first>:
6	400548: 48 8d 77 01		lea		0x1(%rdi),%rsi		F1: x+1
7	40054c: 48 83 ef 01		sub		$0x1,%rdi		F2: x-1
8	400550: e8 eb ff ff ff		callq		400540 <last>		F3: Call last(x-1,x+1)
9	400555: f3 c3			repz retq				F4: Return
	⋮
10	400560: e8 e3 ff ff ff		callq		400548 <first>		M1: Call first(10)
11	400565: 48 89 c2		mov		%rax,%rdx		M2: Resume

- M1 to F2 the value of %rsp goes from 0x7fffffffe820 to 0x7fffffffe818, which is a decrease of 2 bytes. This is because the instruction at F1 is a lea instruction which does not involve any stack operations and does not affect the stack pointer. The call instruction at M1 is the one that pushes the return address onto the stack, and this is the operation that causes the decrease in the value of the %rsp from 0x7fffffffe820 to 0x7fffffffe818.

- The difference between M1 to F2 and F3 to L1 is that the call instruction at F3 invokes another function, it pushes the return address onto the stack, so the execution can return back to the calling function after the called function returns. This operation requires 8 bytes, while the call instruction at M1 only pushes return address which is 8 bytes. This is the standard mechanism for function call in x86-64 architecture
