- Arrays in C are one means of aggregating scalar data into larger data types
q; what does scalar mean in this context?
a; In computer programming, scalar data refers to individual values that are not made up of other values. These are the most basic type of data and include simple types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and characters.

A scalar value is a single unit of data. For example, a single integer like 42 or a single character like 'a' are scalar values. They can also be simple true/false (boolean) values. These are contrasted with non-scalar data types, such as arrays and structures, which can hold multiple values.

- One unusual feature of C is that we can generate pointers to elements within arrays and perform arithmetic with these pointers. These are translated into address computations in machine code.


```c

short	S[7];
short	*T[3];
short	**U[6];
int		V[8];
double	*W[4];
```

q; why is the element size for S 2?
a; The element size for S is 2 because the data type "short" requires 2 bytes. In the statement "short S[7];" S is an array of type short and [] means it can hold 7 elements, each element is of size 2 bytes as mentioned before, thus the total size for array S is 2 * 7 = 14 bytes.

q;  why T is 8?
a; The element size for T is 8 because T is an array of pointers. Each element in T is a pointer to a short, which is 8 bytes long.
