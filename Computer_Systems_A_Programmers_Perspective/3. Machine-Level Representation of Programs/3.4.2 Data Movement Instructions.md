q; what does it mean when a register is in brackets?
When a register is enclosed in parentheses, like `(%eax)`, it generally indicates that the register is being used as a memory address pointer rather than as a register to hold data.

In assembly language, registers are often used to hold memory addresses, and can be used as the source or destination in memory-to-memory operations, or as the operand of an instruction that accesses memory.

When a register is used in this way, it indicates the memory address of the operand or data being acted upon by the instruction. So in instruction `movl %eax, (%ebx)` `%ebx` is used as a pointer to memory location, instead of a register holding data, this is the destination and %eax is the source of the data. So this instruction will move the 32-bit data from %eax to memory location that is pointed by %ebx.

q; what's an instruction class?
a; instructions in the same clases perform the same operation but with different operand sizes

q; what's an example of an operand class
a; mov for copying an instruction from a source to dest location.
there is movb, movw, movl (double word 4bytes), and movq (quadword 8 bytes)

q; what size must the register used in an instruction be?
a; the register used in the instruction must match the size designated by the last character of the instruction. For example, if an instruction has a last character of 'b', then the register used in the instruction must be 8 bits in size.

#### cltq
q; what does cltq mean?
a; convert long to quadword 

q; what does it do?
a: used to sign-extend a 32bit value in the %eax register to a 64-bit val in the %rax register

q;  how are the %eax and %rax registers related?
a; 
1) %rax is the 64 bit version of 32bit %eax
2) the lower-order 32bits are the same as %eax, and the higher order 32bits are usually set to 0.2) the lower -order 32bits are the same as %eax, and the higher order bits 32bits are usually set to 0.
	When you are accessing %eax, you are effectively accessing the lower 32 bits of rax. Both share the same physical register
1) the clqt sign extends the 32bit val in %eax to a full 64 bis in %rax

### problem 3.3
```
movb	$0xF, (%ebx)	Cannot use %ebx as address register
movl	%rax, (%rsp)	Mismatch between instruction suffix and register ID
movw	(%rax),4(%rsp)	Cannot have both source and destination be memory references
movb	%al,%sl		No register named %sl
movl	%eax,$0x123	Cannot have immediate as destination
movl	%eax,%dx	Destination operand incorrect size
movb	%si, 8(%rbp)	Mismatch between instruction suffix and register ID
```
#### movl	%rax, (%rsp)
The operation "movl %rax, (%rsp)" will not work as intended due to a mismatch between the instruction suffix and register ID. 

The instruction mov is used to move data from one location to another and the instruction suffix "l" specify the size of the data. 

In this case, the instruction suffix "l" stands for long, which specifies a 32-bit value. %rax, is a 64-bit register so it won't match with the instruction suffix "l" which specifies the instruction to work on 32-bit data. 

Additionally, (%rsp) is the memory location on the stack pointer which also needs to be 32-bit to match the instruction suffix. 

To fix the issue, you can either change the instruction suffix to "q" (quad word, 64-bit) to match the register size or change the register to a 32-bit register like %eax, to match the instruction suffix. 

It is important to be aware of the size of data you are working with and match it with instruction suffix.
