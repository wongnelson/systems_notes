q; what is single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)
a; the same operation is performed on a number of different data values in parallel

q; what are YMM registers?
a; a type of register on a computer's processor that is used to hold and manipulate data. It is an extension of the XMM (XMM register) that is used in the x86-64 architecture. The AVX floating-point architecture allows data to be stored in 16 YMM registers with the range YM0-YM15

Each YMM register can hold eight 32-bit values, or four 64-bit values, at a time. These values can be either integers or floating-point numbers. The YMM registers are wider than the XMM registers, which can only hold four 32-bit values or two 64-bit values at a time. This allows for more efficient processing of larger data sets, as more data can be loaded into the registers at once. Â Each YMM register is 256 bits (32 bytes) long. When operating on scalar data, these registers only hold floating-point data, and only the low-order 32 bits (for float) or 64 bits (for double) are used

The YMM registers are used in a variety of operations, such as vector arithmetic, data shuffling, and other advanced operations. They are also used in the AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) instruction set, which provides a set of instructions that can perform operations on the YMM registers. This allows for more efficient and powerful processing of data, and is particularly useful for applications that require large amounts of data to be processed, such as scientific simulations, video and image processing, and machine learning. 

q; why is it called XMM and YMM
a; 
The names "XMM" and "YMM" are acronyms that stand for "XMM Register" and "YMM Register", respectively. The "X" and "Y" likely stand for "extended" or "advanced," indicating that these registers are an extension or advanced version of the traditional general-purpose registers in the x86-64 architecture.

The naming convention is consistent with the naming of other registers in the x86-64 architecture, such as the "MMX" (Multimedia eXtensions) registers. These names are used by the processor and software developers to refer to these specific registers and the operations that can be performed on them.

A double-precision floating-point value is typically stored as a 64-bit binary representation. The bits in this representation are divided into several fields, including the sign bit, the exponent, and the mantissa.

A packed double-precision floating-point value is formed by storing two adjacent double-precision floating-point values in a single 128-bit register. In this representation, each double-precision floating-point value is stored as a 64-bit binary representation, and the two 64-bit binary representations are concatenated to form the 128-bit binary representation of the packed double-precision floating-point value.
