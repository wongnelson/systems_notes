1. Formula: Row-major layout: In this layout, the elements of each row are stored contiguously in memory. 
2. The element at position (i, j) can be accessed at the memory location base_address + (i\*number_of_columns + j)\*size_of_element.

As an example, consider the 5×3 integer array `A` defined earlier. Suppose x`A`, _`i`_, and _`j`_ are in registers `%rdi, %rsi`, and `%rdx`, respectively. Then array element `A[i][j]` can be copied to register `%eax` by the following code:

```

	A in %rdi, i in %rsi, and j in %rdx
1	leaq	(%rsi,%rsi,2), %rax		Compute 3i
2	leaq	(%rdi,%rax,4), %rax		Compute xA + 12i
3	movl	(%rax,%rdx,4), %eax		Read from M[xA + 12i + 4]
```

As can be seen, this code computes the element's address as x`A` + 12i + 4j = x`A` + 4(3i + j) using the scaling and addition capabilities of x86-64 address arithmetic.

q: why is "leaq (%rsi,%rsi,2), %rax"

a; 
1) (%rsi,%rsi,2) multiplies i by 3.
2) The reason for ^ is because In order to calculate the address of an element in the array, it is necessary to take into account both the row and column indices.

In the code, i is used to represent the row index and j is used to represent the column index. Since the array has 3 columns, the size of each row is 3 times the size of an integer. Therefore, to calculate the offset of a specific row, we need to multiply the row index (i) by the number of columns (3) so that we can find the starting address of the row.

the instruction "leaq (%rsi,%rsi,2), %rax" . It is essentially computing the offset of the row within the array and storing it in the %rax register.

Example:
+------------+------------+------------+
|            |            | Column 0   | Column 1   | Column 2   |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Row 0      |            | 0x1004     | 0x1008     | 0x100C     |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Row 1      |            | 0x1010     | 0x1014     | 0x1018     |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Row 2      |            | 0x101C     | 0x1020     | 0x1024     |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Row 3      |            | 0x1028     | 0x102C     | 0x1030     |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Row 4      |            | 0x1034     | 0x1038     | 0x103C     |
+------------+------------+------------+
let's say the base address xA is stored at memory address 0x1000. The array A is stored in memory starting at address xA,

And we want to access the element at position (2,1) in the array A, which is 23.
1.  The instruction "leaq (%rsi,%rsi,2), %rax" is used to calculate the offset of the row within the array by multiplying the row index (i = 2) by the number of columns (3) and storing the result in the %rax register:

3*2 = 6

2.  The instruction "leaq (%rdi,%rax,4), %rax" is used to calculate the memory address of the start of the row by adding the offset of the row (6) to the base address (xA) and storing the result in the %rax register:

xA + 6*4 = xA + 24

3.  Finally, the instruction "movl (%rax,%rdx,4), %eax" reads 4 bytes at the address of the element which is computed by adding the offset of the element within the row (j = 1) to the memory address of the row:

(%rax + 4*j) = (%rax + 4) = xA + 24 + 4 = xA + 28

Therefore, all three instructions computes the address of the element A[2][1] = M[xA + 28] = 0x1020 = 23, and copy it to %eax.

The calculation "0x1000 (base address) + 28 bytes = 0x1020 (memory address of the element A[2][1])" is based on the assumption that each element in the array A takes 4 bytes in memory and the array A is a two-dimensional array with 3 columns and 5 rows, as specified in the code example.

Each element in the array A takes 4 bytes in memory, so the offset for each row is 4*3 = 12 bytes, each element's offset within a row is 4 bytes and the offset for each element in the array is the row offset plus the element offset within the row.

If we want to find the memory address of the element A[2][1], we need to calculate the offset of the element from the base address xA.

The row offset is (i = 2) * 12 = 24, the element offset is (j = 1) * 4 = 4, so the total offset of the element A[2][1] is 24 + 4 = 28 bytes. Therefore, if we add this offset to the base address xA, we get the memory address of the element A[2][1]:

xA + 28 = 0x1000 + 28 = 0x1020

So the instruction above is used to calculate the memory address of the element A[2][1], which is stored at the memory address 0x1020, and move its value to the %eax register.

1.  Consider the following source code, where M and N are constants declared with `#define`:
    
    ```c
    
    long P[M][N];
    long Q[N][M];
    long sum_element(long i, long j) {
    	return P[i][j] + Q[j][i];
    }
    ```
    
    In compiling this program, gcc generates the following assembly code:
    
    ```c
    
    	long sum_element(long i, long j)
    	i in %rdi, j in %rsi
    1	sum_element:
    2	leaq	0(,%rdi,8), %rdx
    3	subq	%rdi, %rdx
    4	addq	%rsi, %rdx
    5	leaq	(%rsi,%rsi,4), %rax
    6	addq	%rax, %rdi
    7	movq	Q(,%rdi,8), %rax
    8	addq	P(,%rdx,8), %rax
    9	ret
    ```
    
    Use your reverse engineering skills to determine the values of M and N based on this assembly code.
A: 
-   This problem requires you to work through the scaling operations to determine the address computations, and to apply [Equation 3.1](https://reader.960960.xyz/OPS/xhtml/fileP7000497027000000000000000002B19.xhtml#P7000497027000000000000000002C39) for row-major indexing. The first step is to annotate the assembly code to determine how the address references are computed:
    
    ```c
    
    	long sum_element(long i, long j)
    	i in %rdi, j in %rsi
    1	sum_element:	
    2	  leaq	0(,%rdi,8), %rdx	Compute 8i
    3	  subq	%rdi, %rdx		Compute 7i
    4	  addq %rsi, %rdx		Compute 7i + j
    5	  leaq	(%rsi,%rsi,4), %rax	Compute 5j
    6	  addq	%rax, %rdi		Compute i + 5j
    7	  movq	Q(,%rdi,8), %rax	Retrieve M[xQ + 8 (5j + i)]
    8	  addq	P(,%rdx,8), %rax	Add M[xP + 8 (7i + j)]
    9	  ret		
    ```
    
    We can see that the reference to matrix `P` is at byte offset 8 · (7i + j), while the reference to matrix `Q` is at byte offset 8 · (5j + i). From this, we can determine that `P` has 7 columns, while `Q` has 5, giving M = 5 and N = 7.

##### q; explain "leaq	0(,%rdi,8), %rdx	Compute 8i"
a; `leaq 0(,%rdi,8), %rdx` is an instruction in the x86 assembly language. It is a combination of two instruction LEA(Load Effective Address) and ADD, where ADD instruction does the calculation part and LEA instruction loads the result into the destination register.

The instruction `leaq 0(,%rdi,8), %rdx` calculates an effective address (EA) and loads it into the destination register %rdx.

The effective address (EA) calculation is done by adding the base address of the array P (0) to the product of the index i and 8. The instruction `0(,%rdi,8)` is the effective address calculation which takes the base address of array P (0) and adds it to the product of index i and 8. The resulting effective address points to the memory location where the element at index i, j of array P is stored.

In summary, this instruction calculates the memory location where P[i][j] is stored and loads that memory address into register %rdx

q: why is the 0 necessary?
a; The "0" is necessary because it represents the base address of the array. It is the starting memory location of the array. Without it, the instruction would not have a valid memory location to refer to and calculate the address from. The instruction "lea" is a Load Effective Address instruction, it loads an address into a register but not a value, it's commonly used to calculate memory address in a more efficient way than performing the calculation in multiple instructions. So the instruction is used to get the memory address of an array element based on the value of %rdi which is the first argument of the function (i), by multiplying it by 8(the size of long data type) and adding it to the base address of the array, which is 0 in this case, and storing the resulting memory address in the %rdx register. In short, the instruction calculates the memory address of an array element by multiplying an index by the size of an element in the array, and then adding it to the base address of the array.

q; What was the intention of doing "leaq 0(,%rdi,8), %rdx" instead of leaq 0(,%rdi,7), %rdx to get  7i?
a; The choice between the two instructions is likely to depend on the architecture, the instruction set, the memory addressing mechanism and the specific optimization options that have been used.

The instruction set and the memory addressing mechanisms on different architectures may have an impact on the choice of instruction used for this purpose. In x86-64 architecture, the instruction "lea" is commonly used for efficient memory address computation, in this case, the instruction "leaq 0(,%rdi,8), %rdx" could have been chosen for its ability to efficiently handle larger memory addresses. Additionally, the instruction "leaq 0(,%rdi,8), %rdx" would have the same effect as "leaq 0(,%rdi,7), %rdx" in terms of computing the memory address of an array element, but with a simpler and more efficient instruction, this might reflect the intention of the developer or the optimizer to get the best performance possible, with simple and efficient instructions.
