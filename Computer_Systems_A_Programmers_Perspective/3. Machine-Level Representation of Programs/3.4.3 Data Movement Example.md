q; in what register is a return value stored in?
a; %rax, or in one of the low-order portions of this register
- - - 
```c
long exchange(long *xp, long y)
{
	long x = *xp;
	*xp = y;
	return x;
}
```
This is a function written in C language that takes two arguments, a pointer to a long integer and a long integer. It performs the following operations:

1.  Declares a variable x of type long and assigns it the value stored in the memory location pointed to by the first argument (*xp).
2.  Assigns the value of the second argument (y) to the memory location pointed to by the first argument (*xp).
3.  Returns the value of the x variable, which was the original value stored in the memory location pointed to by the first argument (*xp) before the function was called.

Example: Let's assume we have the following variable declarations in our program: long a = 10; long b = 20;

We can call the function like this: long original_value = exchange(&a, b);

In this example, the input would be &a and b, where &a is the address of the variable a and b is the variable that contains the value 20.

The function will do the following:

1.  Declares a variable x of type long and assigns it the value stored in the memory location &a which is 10
2.  Assigns the value of the b which is 20 to the memory location &a.
3.  Returns the value of x which is 10.

So, after the function call, the variable a will contain the value 20, and the variable original_value will contain the value 10.

Note that, the function here is exchanging values of the two variables, hence the name exchange.

### Practice problem 3.4
Assume variables sp and dp are declared with types
```c
src_t *sp;
dest_t *dp;
```
where `src_t` and `dest_t` are data types declared with `typedef`. We wish to use the appropriate pair of data movement instructions to implement the operation

```c
*dp = (dest_t) *sp;
```
The expression `*dp = (dest_t) *sp;` is a statement in C or C++ that assigns the value of the expression `(dest_t) *sp` to the memory location pointed to by `dp`. The `*` operator is used to dereference the pointer, which means to access the memory location pointed to by the pointer.

The `(dest_t)` is a type cast, which is used to convert the value stored in the memory location pointed to by `sp` to the data type `dest_t`. This is necessary because the data type `src_t` of the memory location pointed to by `sp` may not be the same as the data type `dest_t` of the memory location pointed to by `dp`.

So in summary, the expression assigns the value stored in memory location pointed by `sp` and type casted to `dest_t` to the memory location pointed by `dp`.

q; what does `long x = *xp` do?
a; read the value stored in the location designated by `xp` and store it as a local variable named `x`. This read operation is known as pointer _dereferencing_. The C operator `*' performs pointer dereferencing. The statement
