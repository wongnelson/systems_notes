q; we do pushq S, what happens?
a; `pushq S` is an assembly instruction that pushes the value S onto the top of the stack. The stack is a memory region in the computer's memory that is used for storing temporary data during program execution. The instruction `pushq` is used to add an element to the top of the stack.

`R[%rsp] ← R[%rsp] –8` is a way to describe that the instruction is decreasing the value of the stack pointer (R[%rsp]) by 8 bytes. The stack pointer (R[%rsp]) is a register that holds the address of the top of the stack. Decrementing the stack pointer by 8 bytes moves the stack pointer to the next available location on the stack, which is the location where the value of S will be stored.

`M[R[%rsp]] ← S` is a way to say that the value of S is stored at the memory location pointed to by the stack pointer (R[%rsp]). The `M[]` notation refers to memory, so this instruction is storing the value of S at the memory address stored in the stack pointer register. In this way, the value of S is now at the top of the stack and can be accessed later with pop instruction.

q; what's the equivalent of pushq?
a; 
```c
subq $8,%rsp // Decrement stack pointer 
movq %rbp,( %rsp) // Store %rbp on stack
```

q; why is pushq better?
a; pushq instruction is encoded in the machine code as a single byte, whereas the pair of instructions shown above requires a total of 8 bytes
