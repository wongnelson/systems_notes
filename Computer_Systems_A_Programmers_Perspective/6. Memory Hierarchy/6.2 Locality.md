q; what is the principle of locality?
a; when a computer program tends to reference data items that are near recently referenced data items or that were recently referenced themselves

q; what is temporal locality?
a; Temporal locality is a property of computer systems that refers to the tendency of programs to access data that was recently accessed. In other words, if a program accesses a particular data item, there is a high likelihood that the same data item will be accessed again in the near future.

q; what is spacial locality?
a; Spatial locality is a property of computer systems that refers to the tendency of programs to access data that is stored near data that was recently accessed. In other words, if a program accesses a particular data item, there is a high likelihood that nearby data items will also be accessed in the near future.

q; why is locality important?
a;  At the hardware level, the principle of locality allows computer designers to speed up main memory accesses by introducing small fast memories known as _cache memories_ that hold blocks of the most recently referenced instructions and data items


## Reference paterns
### What are reference patterns in computer systems?

Reference patterns refer to the patterns in which a program accesses data. These patterns can include the order in which data is accessed, the frequency of access, and the size of the data being accessed.

### Why is understanding reference patterns important?

Understanding reference patterns is important because it can provide insight into the performance of the system, including the efficiency of the cache memory and the memory hierarchy.

### How do reference patterns affect the performance of a system?

Reference patterns can have a significant impact on the performance of a system. For example, if a program has a reference pattern that is characterized by sequential access to large blocks of data, it may benefit from larger cache blocks, which can store more data and reduce the number of cache misses. On the other hand, if a program has a reference pattern that is characterized by random access to small blocks of data, it may benefit from smaller cache blocks, which can reduce the overhead of cache management.

```c

1	int sumvec(int v[N])
2	{
3		int i, sum = 0;
4	
5		for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
6			sum += v[i];
7		return sum;
8	}
```

q; what type of reference pattern is sumvec?
a; stride-1 reference patterns because it's a _sequential reference pattern

q; what if we visit every kth element in a contiguous vector?
a; _stride-k reference pattern_

q; what happens when the stride increases?
a; the spatial locality decreases

## How does the sumarrayrows function in Figure 6.18(a) demonstrate good spatial locality?
```c
1	int sumarrayrows(int a[M][N])
2	{
3		int i, j, sum = 0;
4	
5		for (i = 0; i < M; i++)
6			for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
7				sum += a[i] [j];
8		return sum;
9	}
```
| Address | 0   | 4   | 8   | 12  | 16  | 20  |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Contents | a00 | a01 | a02 | a10 | a11 | a12 |
| Access order | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

The sumarrayrows function demonstrates good spatial locality by accessing the elements of a two-dimensional array in row-major order. The inner loop reads the elements of the first row, then the second row, and so on. This access pattern results in a stride-1 reference pattern, with excellent spatial locality, as the array is accessed in the same row-major order in which it is stored in memory.

## How do loop interchange and array access patterns affect spatial locality, as shown in the sumarraycols function in Figure 6.19(a)?
```c

1	int sumarraycols(int a[M][N])
2	{
3		int i, j, sum = 0 ;
4	
5		for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
6			for (i = 0; i < M; i++)
7				sum += a[i] [j];
8		return sum;
9	}
```
| Address | 0   | 4   | 8   | 12  | 16  | 20  |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Contents | a00 | a01 | a02 | a10 | a11 | a12 |
| Access order | 1 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 6 |

The sumarraycols function computes the same result as the sumarrayrows function, but with the i and j loops interchanged. This seemingly trivial change has a significant impact on spatial locality. The sumarraycols function suffers from poor spatial locality because it scans the array column-wise instead of row-wise. Since C arrays are laid out in memory row-wise, the result is a stride-N reference pattern, as shown in Figure 6.19(b), which degrades spatial locality and can impact performance.

## How can the locality of instruction fetches be evaluated?

The locality of a program with respect to its instruction fetches can be evaluated by examining how instructions are accessed in memory during execution. For example, if instructions in the body of a loop are executed in sequential memory order, the loop enjoys good spatial locality. Since the loop body is executed multiple times, it also enjoys good temporal locality. In general, loops have good temporal and spatial locality with respect to instruction fetches. The smaller the loop body and the greater the number of loop iterations, the better the locality.

## What is an important property of code that distinguishes it from program data?

An important property of code that distinguishes it from program data is that it is rarely modified at runtime. While a program is executing, the CPU reads its instructions from memory. The CPU rarely overwrites or modifies these instructions.

## What are some simple rules for qualitatively evaluating locality in a program?

There are a few simple rules for qualitatively evaluating locality in a program:

1.  Programs that repeatedly reference the same variables enjoy good temporal locality.
2.  For programs with stride-k reference patterns, the smaller the stride, the better the spatial locality. Programs with stride-1 reference patterns have good spatial locality, while programs that hop around memory with large strides have poor spatial locality.
3.  Loops have good temporal and spatial locality with respect to instruction fetches. The smaller the loop body and the greater the number of loop iterations, the better the locality.

## Why is it useful to know how to glance at source code and get a high-level feel for the locality in the program?

Knowing how to glance at a source code and get a high-level feel for the locality in the program is a useful and important skill for a programmer to master. This is because programs with good locality typically run faster than programs with poor locality. Understanding the locality of a program can help identify areas for optimization, leading to better performance and more efficient use of memory and cache resources.

## 6.7
1.  Permute the loops in the following function so that it scans the three-dimensional array a with a stride-1 reference pattern.
    
    ```c
    
    1	int sumarray3d(int a[N][N][N])
    2	{
    3		int i, j, k, sum = 0 ;
    4	
    5		for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    6			for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    7				for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
    8					sum += a[k] [i] [j];
    9				}
    10			}
    11		}
    12		return sum;
    13	}
    ```
A:
To create a stride-1 reference pattern, the loops must be permuted so that the rightmost indices change most rapidly.

```c

1	int sumarray3d(int a[N][N][N])
2	{
3		int i, j, k, sum = 0;
4
5		for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
6			for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
7				for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
8					sum += a[k][i][j];
9				}
10			}
11		}
12		return sum;
13	}
```

In this code, the outermost loop is `for (k = 0; k < N; k++)`, followed by `for (i = 0; i < N; i++)` and finally `for (j = 0; j < N; j++)`. The order of the loops determines the order in which elements of the three-dimensional array `a` are accessed.

When the loops are permuted such that the rightmost index (i.e., `j`) changes most rapidly, it results in a stride-1 reference pattern. This is because, in a three-dimensional array, the rightmost index represents the most significant change in the memory layout. As `j` changes the fastest, it causes the consecutive memory locations to be accessed, resulting in a stride-1 reference pattern.

For example, consider the following memory layout of the array `a`:
```c
a[0][0][0] a[0][0][1] a[0][0][2] ... a[0][0][N-1]
a[0][1][0] a[0][1][1] a[0][1][2] ... a[0][1][N-1]
...
a[0][N-1][0] a[0][N-1][1] a[0][N-1][2] ... a[0][N-1][N-1]
...
a[N-1][N-1][N-1]
```
With the permuted loop order, `j` changes the fastest, causing the memory locations to be accessed in the following sequence:

```c
a[0][0][0] a[0][1][0] a[0][2][0] ... a[0][N-1][0]
a[1][0][0] a[1][1][0] a[1][2][0] ... a[1][N-1][0]
...
a[N-1][0][0] a[N-1][1][0] a[N-1][2][0] ... a[N-1][N-1][0]
...
a[N-1][N-1][N-1]
```
As you can see, the consecutive memory locations are accessed, resulting in a stride-1 reference pattern, which is more cache-friendly and results in improved performance.


## 6.8

1.  The three functions below perform the same operation with varying degrees of spatial locality. Rank-order the functions with respect to the spatial locality enjoyed by each. Explain how you arrived at your ranking.
a) An array of `structs`

```

1	#define N 1000
2	
3	typedef struct {
4		int vel [3];
5		int acc [3];
6	} point;
7	
8	point p [N];
```

(b) The `clearl` function

```

1	void clearl(point *p, int n)
2	{
3		int i, j;
4	
5		for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
6			for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)
7				p[i] .vel[j] = 0;
8			for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)
9				p[i] .acc[j] = 0;
10		}
11	}
```

(c) The `clear2` function

```

1	void clear2(point *p, int n)
2	{
3		int i, j;
4	
5		for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
6			for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
7				p[i] .vel[j] = 0;
8				p[i] .acc[j] = 0;
9			}
10		}
11	}
```

(d) The `clear3` function

```

1	void clear3(point *p, int n)
2	{
3		int i, j;
4	
5		for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
6			for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
7				p[i] .vel[j] = 0;
8			for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
9				p[i] .acc[j] = 0;
10		}
11	}
```

The solution you provided correctly describes the spatial locality of the three functions `clear1`, `clear2`, and `clear3`.

`clear1` has the best spatial locality because it accesses the elements of the `vel` and `acc` arrays in a stride-1 reference pattern. In this function, the two inner loops `for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)` and `for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)` iterate over the elements of the `vel` and `acc` arrays in a contiguous manner, accessing memory locations that are close to each other in the memory layout. This results in good cache behavior and improved performance.

`clear2` has better spatial locality compared to `clear3`, but worse than `clear1`. This is because it processes the elements of the `vel` and `acc` arrays for a single `i` value before moving on to the next `i` value, causing the memory accesses for a single `i` value to be non-contiguous. The two inner loops `for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)` and `for (j = 0; j < 3; j++)` iterate over the elements of the `vel` and `acc` arrays, but the memory access pattern hops from one value of `i` to the next, causing cache misses to occur.

`clear3` has the worst spatial locality compared to `clear1` and `clear2`. This is because in `clear3`, the loop over `j` is the outermost loop, causing the memory accesses to be non-contiguous. The memory access pattern hops from one value of `j` to the next, causing cache misses to occur. The two inner loops `for (i = 0; i < n; i++)` iterate over the elements of the `vel` and `acc` arrays, but the memory access pattern hops from one value of `j` to the next, causing cache misses to occur.
