## What are the fundamental and enduring properties of storage technology and computer software?

The fundamental and enduring properties of storage technology and computer software are:

1.  Storage technology: Different storage technologies have widely different access times. Faster technologies cost more per byte than slower ones and have less capacity. The gap between CPU and main memory speed is widening.
2.  Computer software: Well-written programs tend to exhibit good locality.

## What is the memory hierarchy and how does it complement the properties of hardware and software?

The memory hierarchy is an approach for organizing memory systems used in all modern computer systems. It complements the properties of hardware and software by taking advantage of the differences in storage technologies and the locality exhibited by well-written programs. The memory hierarchy consists of multiple levels of storage devices, with each level being slower, cheaper, and larger as we move from higher to lower levels.

## What are the different levels in a typical memory hierarchy?

A typical memory hierarchy consists of the following levels:

1.  L0: CPU registers - a small number of fast registers that the CPU can access in a single clock cycle.
2.  L1, L2, etc.: Cache memories - one or more small to moderate-size SRAM-based cache memories that can be accessed in a few CPU clock cycles.
3.  Main memory: A large DRAM-based main memory that can be accessed in tens to hundreds of clock cycles.
4.  Local disks: Slow but enormous local disks.
5.  Remote disks: Additional level of disks on remote servers that can be accessed over a network, such as distributed file systems (e.g., Andrew File System or Network File System) or the World Wide Web.

## How do distributed file systems and the World Wide Web fit into the memory hierarchy?

Distributed file systems, such as the Andrew File System (AFS) or the Network File System (NFS), and the World Wide Web fit into the memory hierarchy as an additional level of storage. They allow programs to access files stored on remote network-connected servers, providing an even larger and slower storage option compared to local disks. These systems can be accessed over a network and offer virtually unlimited storage capacity by connecting multiple servers across the world.
