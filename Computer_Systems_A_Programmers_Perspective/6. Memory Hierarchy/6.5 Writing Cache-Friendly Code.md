## 6.17
Transposing the rows and columns of a matrix is an important problem in signal processing and scientific computing applications. It is also interesting from a locality point of view because its reference pattern is both row-wise and column-wise. For example, consider the following transpose routine:

```c

1	typedef int array[2][2];
2
3	void transpose1(array dst, array src)
4	{
5		int i, j;
6
7		for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
8			for (j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
9				dst[j][i] = src[i][j];
10			}
11		}
12	}
```

Assume this code runs on a machine with the following properties:

-   `sizeof(int)` = 4.
    
-   The `src` array starts at address 0 and the `dst` array starts at address 16 (decimal).
    
-   There is a single L1 data cache that is direct-mapped, write-through, and write-allocate, with a block size of 8 bytes.
    
-   The cache has a total size of 16 data bytes and the cache is initially empty.
    
-   Accesses to the `src` and `dst` arrays are the only sources of read and write misses, respectively.
    

1.  For each `row` and `col`, indicate whether the access to `src[row][col]` and `dst[row][col]` is a hit (h) or a miss (m). For example, reading `src\[0]\[0]` is a miss and writing `dst\[0]\[0]` is also a miss.

2. Repeat the problem for a cache with 32 data bytes.

Notice that each cache line holds exactly one row of the array, that the cache is exactly large enough to hold one array, and that for all i, row i of `src` and `dst` maps to the same cache line. Because the cache is too small to hold both arrays, references to one array keep evicting useful lines from the other array. For example, the write to `dst\[0]\[0]` evicts the line that was loaded when we read `src\[0]\[0]`. So when we next read `src\[0][1]`, we have a miss.
dst array	           src array
Col. 0	Col. 1		Col. 0	Col. 1
Row 0	m	m	      Row 0	m	m
Row 1	m	m	       Row 1	m	m

dst array	           src array
Col. 0	Col. 1		Col. 0	Col. 1
Row 0	m	h	      Row 0	m	h
Row 1	m	h	      Row 1	m	h

1.  `src\[0]\[0]` is a miss, as the cache is initially empty and `src\[0]\[0]` has not been loaded into the cache yet.
    
2.  `dst\[0]\[0]` is a miss, as the cache is initially empty and `dst\[0]\[0]` has not been loaded into the cache yet.
    
3.  `src\[0][1]` is a hit, as `src\[0][1]` is stored in the same cache block as `src\[0]\[0]` and was loaded into the cache in the previous access.
    
4.  `dst[1]\[0]` is a hit, as `dst[1]\[0]` is stored in the same cache block as `dst\[0]\[0]` and was loaded into the cache in the previous access.
    
5.  `src[1]\[0]` is a hit, as `src[1]\[0]` is stored in a different cache block from `src\[0]\[0]` but in the same cache set, and the cache is direct-mapped, so it will replace `src\[0]\[0]` in the cache.
    
6.  `dst\[0][1]` is a hit, as `dst\[0][1]` is stored in a different cache block from `dst\[0]\[0]` but in the same cache set, and the cache is direct-mapped, so it will replace `dst\[0]\[0]` in the cache.
    
7.  `src[1][1]` is a hit, as `src[1][1]` is stored in a different cache block from `src\[0][1]` but in the same cache set, and the cache is direct-mapped, so it will replace `src\[0][1]` in the cache.
    
8.  `dst[1][1]` is a hit, as `dst[1][1]` is stored in a different cache block from `dst[1]\[0]` but in the same cache set, and the cache is direct-mapped, so it will replace `dst[1]\[0]` in the cache.
    

Therefore, all of the accesses to both `src` and `dst` arrays result in cache hits except for the first access to each array. The cache is able to hold four 8-byte blocks of data, which allows for all of the subsequent accesses to the `src` and `dst` arrays to be cached, reducing the number of cache misses and improving the overall performance of the program.

## 6.18
1.  The heart of the recent hit game _SimAquarium_ is a tight loop that calculates the average position of 256 algae. You are evaluating its cache performance on a machine with a 1,024-byte direct-mapped data cache with 16-byte blocks (B = 16). You are given the following definitions:
    
    ```
    
    1	struct algae_position {
    2		int x;
    3		int y;
    4	};
    5
    6	struct algae_position grid[16][16];
    7	int total_x = 0, total_y = 0;
    8	int i, j;
    ```
    
    You should also assume the following:
    
    -   `sizeof(int)` = 4.
        
    -   `grid` begins at memory address 0.
        
    -   The cache is initially empty.
        
    -   The only memory accesses are to the entries of the array `grid.` Variables `i, j, total_x`, and `total_y` are stored in registers.
        
    
    Determine the cache performance for the following code:
    
    ```
    
    1	for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    2		for (j = 0; j < 16; j++) {
    3			total_x += grid[i][j].x;
    4		}
    5	}
    6
    7	for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    8		for (j = 0; j < 16; j++) {
    9			total_y += grid[i][j].y;
    10		}
    11	}
    ```
    
    1.  What is the total number of reads?
        
    2.  What is the total number of reads that miss in the cache?
        
    3.  What is the miss rate?

### 1
16\*16\*2 = 512

### 2
In the `grid` array, each `algae_position` structure is 8 bytes in size (two `int` fields, each 4 bytes in size). Since each cache line is 16 bytes in size, two contiguous `algae_position` structures can be stored in a single cache line.

In the first loop (`total_x`), the `grid` array is traversed row by row, so each iteration of the outer loop accesses a new row of the array, and each iteration of the inner loop accesses the next `algae_position` structure in that row. Since each `algae_position` structure is 8 bytes in size, and two structures can fit in each 16-byte cache line, the loop accesses every other cache line in memory order.

Similarly, in the second loop (`total_y`), the `grid` array is traversed column by column, so each iteration of the outer loop accesses a new column of the array, and each iteration of the inner loop accesses the next `algae_position` structure in that column. Again, the loop accesses every other cache line in memory order.

Since the cache is direct-mapped, each cache line can hold data from only one block of memory. Therefore, when the loop accesses every other cache line, every other access will result in a cache miss, because the requested data is not in the cache. This means that half of the total read accesses (256 out of 512) will result in cache misses.

Specifically, in each loop, the first access to a cache line will miss, because the cache is initially empty. The second access to that cache line will hit, because the data from the previous access is still in the cache. The third access will miss again, because the cache line has been replaced with data from another block of memory. This pattern continues for every other access, resulting in a total of 128 misses in each loop (for a total of 256 misses overall).

256/512 = 50%

    4			total_y += grid[j][i].y;
    5		}
    6	}
    ```
    
    1.  What is the total number of reads?
        
    2.  What is the total number of reads that miss in the cache?
        
    3.  What is the miss rate?
        
    4.  What would the miss rate be if the cache were twice as big?

### 1
512

### 2
When the cache is direct-mapped and the array is accessed in column-wise order, every other access to the same cache line will result in a cache miss, since the line will be evicted by the next column access. This means that the miss rate will be 50%, since every other access to the same line will miss.

To elaborate on the explanation, the cache can only hold a fraction of the array, since the cache size is smaller than the total size of the array. When the loop first accesses grid\[0]\[0], the cache line containing grid\[0]\[0] and grid\[0][1] is loaded into the cache. When the loop accesses grid[1]\[0], the cache line containing grid\[0]\[0] and grid\[0][1] is evicted from the cache, since the cache can only hold a single line for that set. When the loop then accesses grid[2]\[0], the cache line containing grid[2]\[0] and grid[2][1] is loaded into the cache, and so on.

When the loop reaches the second half of the array, every access to a cache line will evict the line that was loaded during the first half of the loop. For example, when the loop accesses grid[8]\[0], the cache line containing grid\[0]\[0] and grid\[0][1] is evicted from the cache, since it is part of the same cache line set as the line containing grid[8]\[0] and grid\[8][1]. This means that when the loop begins scanning the next column (i.e., grid\[0][1], grid\[1][1], grid\[2][1], etc.), the reference to the first element of grid\[0][1] will miss in the cache, since the cache line containing it was evicted.

Therefore, the miss rate for each loop is 50%, since every other access to the same cache line will miss, due to eviction. This means that the total miss rate for the loop is also 50%.

### 4
 What would the miss rate be if the cache were twice as big? If the cache were twice as big, it could hold the entire grid array. The only misses would be the initial cold misses, and the miss rate would be 1/4 = 25%.


## 6.20
1.  Given the assumptions of [Practice Problem 6.18](file:///OPS/xhtml/fileP7000497027000000000000000005915.xhtml#P7000497027000000000000000005A00), determine the cache performance of the following code:
    
    ```
    
    1	for (i = 0; i < 16; i++){
    2		for (j = 0; j < 16; j++) {
    3			total_x += grid[i][j].x;
    4			total_y += grid[i][j].y;
    5		}
    6	}
    ```
    
        
    2.  What is the total number of reads that miss in the cache?
        
    4.  What would the miss rate be if the cache were twice as big?



### 2

The miss rate of the loop in question is 25% because it only experiences cold misses. When the loop first accesses `grid[0][0]`, the cache line containing `grid[0][0]` and `grid[0][1]` is loaded into the cache. As the loop continues to access elements within the same cache line, the cache has no evictions and all subsequent accesses are hits.

When the loop moves to the next cache line, it experiences a cold miss, meaning that the entire cache line must be brought into the cache from memory. This process only happens once for each cache line, so the total number of misses is equal to the number of cache lines in the array, which is 16.

Therefore, the miss rate is 16 cache lines * 2 `algae_position` structures per cache line * 2 `int` values per `algae_position` structure / 512 total reads = 25%.

In contrast, if the loop were to access the array in column-wise order, the cache would experience conflicts, and the miss rate would be higher than 25%.

### 4
If the cache were twice as big, it would be able to hold the entire `grid` array, which is 256 `algae_position` structures, or 512 `int` values. When the loop first starts, it will experience cold misses for each cache line as they are loaded into the cache. Since there are 16 cache lines, this would result in 16 cold misses.

Once the cache has been warmed up, all subsequent accesses will be hits. This is because the loop accesses the array in row-wise order, and each cache line holds two contiguous `algae_position` structures. As a result, when a cache line is loaded into the cache, the loop will access all of the `int` values within that cache line before moving on to the next cache line. Therefore, there will be no cache evictions and no additional misses once the cache has been warmed up.

The total number of read accesses in the loop is 512, which is the same as in the original problem. Since there are 16 initial cold misses, the miss rate would be 16/512 = 1/4 = 25%, regardless of the size of the cache.
