## What is the memory mountain?

The memory mountain is a two-dimensional function of read throughput, also known as read bandwidth, versus temporal and spatial locality. It characterizes the capabilities of a computer's memory system. By calling a function with different values of size (temporal locality) and stride (spatial locality), we can generate a unique memory mountain for each computer.

## How is read throughput defined?

Read throughput, also known as read bandwidth, is the rate at which a program reads data from the memory system. If a program reads n bytes over a period of s seconds, the read throughput over that period is n/s, typically expressed in units of megabytes per second (MB/s).

## How does the memory mountain relate to cache levels and main memory?

The memory mountain is divided into several ridges that correspond to the regions of temporal locality where the working set fits entirely in the L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, and main memory. The read throughput can vary significantly between these regions, with the highest peak of the L1 ridge being over an order of magnitude higher than the lowest point of the main memory ridge.

## What is the impact of spatial locality on read throughput?

### How does the stride affect spatial locality and read throughput?

The stride is the distance between successive memory accesses. When the stride is small, the memory accesses have good spatial locality, and the processor can easily predict which data will be needed next and prefetch it into the cache or into registers. However, as the stride increases, spatial locality decreases, and the processor has a harder time predicting which data will be needed next. This results in a decrease in read throughput.

### Can good spatial locality still improve read throughput if the program has poor temporal locality?

Temporal locality refers to the likelihood of a program repeatedly accessing the same memory locations. If a program has poor temporal locality, it means that it does not frequently access the same memory locations. In this case, good spatial locality can still help improve read throughput because the processor can still prefetch data from nearby memory locations that are likely to be accessed in the future, even if they are not the same as the previous memory location.

## Why is it important to structure programs to exploit temporal and spatial locality?

By structuring programs to exploit temporal and spatial locality, we can improve their performance by ensuring they run in the peaks of the memory mountain instead of the valleys. The goal is to exploit temporal locality so that heavily used words are fetched from the L1 cache, and to exploit spatial locality so that as many words as possible are accessed from a single L1 cache line.
