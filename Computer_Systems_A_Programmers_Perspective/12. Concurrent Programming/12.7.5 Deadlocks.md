## What is a deadlock?

A deadlock is a run-time error in a multithreaded program where a collection of threads is blocked, waiting for a condition that will never be true. Deadlocks are challenging to predict and prevent, as they might not always occur in every execution of a program. They can cause a program to halt, with each thread waiting for the other to perform an operation that will never happen.

Example:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

pthread_mutex_t lockA;
pthread_mutex_t lockB;

void *thread1(void *arg)
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lockA);
    printf("Thread 1 has acquired lock A\n");

    /* Simulate some work */
    sleep(1);

    pthread_mutex_lock(&lockB);
    printf("Thread 1 has acquired lock B\n");

    /* Do some more work */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lockB);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lockA);

    return NULL;
}

void *thread2(void *arg)
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lockB);
    printf("Thread 2 has acquired lock B\n");

    /* Simulate some work */
    sleep(1);

    pthread_mutex_lock(&lockA);
    printf("Thread 2 has acquired lock A\n");

    /* Do some more work */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lockA);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lockB);

    return NULL;
}

int main(void)
{
    pthread_t tid1, tid2;

    pthread_mutex_init(&lockA, NULL);
    pthread_mutex_init(&lockB, NULL);

    pthread_create(&tid1, NULL, thread1, NULL);
    pthread_create(&tid2, NULL, thread2, NULL);

    pthread_join(tid1, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid2, NULL);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&lockA);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&lockB);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, two threads are created and both try to acquire the same two locks in opposite orders. Thread 1 acquires lock A and then lock B, while thread 2 acquires lock B and then lock A. As a result, each thread is waiting for the other to release a lock, causing a deadlock.

Here is an example code that fixes the deadlock:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 2

pthread_mutex_t mutex1 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t mutex2 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *thread_func_1(void *arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex1);
    printf("Thread 1 has acquired mutex 1\n");
    sleep(1);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex2);
    printf("Thread 1 has acquired mutex 2\n");
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex2);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex1);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

void *thread_func_2(void *arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex2);
    printf("Thread 2 has acquired mutex 2\n");
    sleep(1);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex1);
    printf("Thread 2 has acquired mutex 1\n");
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex1);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex2);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    int rc;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        if (i == 0) {
            rc = pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func_1, NULL);
        } else {
            rc = pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func_2, NULL);
        }
        if (rc) {
            printf("Error: unable to create thread, %d\n", rc);
            exit(-1);
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```
This code fixes the deadlock by ensuring that the threads acquire the locks in a consistent order. Thread 1 first acquires mutex 1 and then mutex 2, while Thread 2 first acquires mutex 2 and then mutex 1. This ensures that the threads do not wait for each other to release the locks, preventing the deadlock.

## What is a progress graph, and how is it useful for understanding deadlock?

A progress graph is a tool for visualizing the execution trajectory of a multithreaded program. It shows how threads progress and interact with each other, specifically when using synchronization primitives like semaphores. By examining a progress graph, you can identify potential deadlock situations, forbidden regions, and overlapping forbidden regions that might lead to deadlock.

For example, Figure 12.44 from the given content shows a progress graph for a program that can deadlock. This graph helps you understand that the programmer has incorrectly ordered the P and V operations, causing overlapping forbidden regions that block progress in every legal direction.

## How can deadlocks be unpredictable?

Deadlocks are unpredictable because they depend on the specific execution trajectory of a program. In some cases, a program might run without any issues multiple times, but then deadlock in a subsequent run. The same program could also work correctly on one machine but deadlock on another. These errors are often not repeatable because different executions have different trajectories, which may or may not lead to deadlock. Like in the thread1 example, if the operating system schedules the threads in such a way that both threads acquire one lock each and then try to acquire the other lock, a deadlock will occur.

## What is the Mutex Lock Ordering Rule?

The Mutex Lock Ordering Rule is a simple and effective rule to prevent deadlocks in programs using binary semaphores for mutual exclusion. The rule states:

> Given a total ordering of all mutexes, a program is deadlock-free if each thread acquires its mutexes in order and releases them in reverse order.

By following this rule, you can avoid overlapping forbidden regions in the progress graph and prevent deadlocks. For example, the deadlock in Figure 12.44 can be fixed by locking semaphore `s` first, then semaphore `t`, in each thread. The resulting progress graph in Figure 12.45 shows a deadlock-free program.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

pthread_mutex_t lock1;
pthread_mutex_t lock2;

void *thread1_func(void *arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock1); // Acquire lock1 first
    sleep(1); // Simulate work
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock2); // Then acquire lock2
    printf("Thread 1 acquired both locks\n");

    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock2); // Release lock2 first
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock1); // Then release lock1
    return NULL;
}

void *thread2_func(void *arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock1); // Acquire lock1 first
    sleep(1); // Simulate work
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock2); // Then acquire lock2
    printf("Thread 2 acquired both locks\n");

    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock2); // Release lock2 first
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock1); // Then release lock1
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread1, thread2;
    pthread_mutex_init(&lock1, NULL);
    pthread_mutex_init(&lock2, NULL);

    pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, thread1_func, NULL);
    pthread_create(&thread2, NULL, thread2_func, NULL);

    pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread2, NULL);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&lock1);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&lock2);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, both threads acquire the mutexes `lock1` and `lock2` in the same order and release them in reverse order. This adheres to the Mutex Lock Ordering Rule, ensuring that the program remains deadlock-free.
