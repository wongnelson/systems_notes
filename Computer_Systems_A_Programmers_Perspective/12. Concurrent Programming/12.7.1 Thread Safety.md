## What is thread safety and why is it important in concurrent programs?

Thread safety is a property of a function that ensures it will always produce correct results when called repeatedly from multiple concurrent threads. When writing concurrent programs, it is important to ensure that functions are thread-safe, as thread-unsafe functions can lead to incorrect results and unpredictable behavior.

## What are the four classes of thread-unsafe functions?

1.  **Class 1: Functions that do not protect shared variables.** These functions can be made thread-safe by protecting shared variables with synchronization operations such as P and V.

Example: A function that increments an unprotected global counter variable.

2.  **Class 2: Functions that keep state across multiple invocations.** These functions need to be rewritten so that they do not use any static data, relying instead on the caller to pass the state information in arguments.

Example: A pseudorandom number generator function.
In its original form, it might use a static seed value and store it between function calls to generate a sequence of random numbers. However, to make the function stateless, the seed value must be passed as an argument to the function, so that the function does not need to rely on any static data.

Here's an example in Python:
```python
import random

def old_rand_gen():
    static_seed = 0
    static_seed = (static_seed * 9301 + 49297) % 233280
    return static_seed / 233280.0

def new_rand_gen(seed):
    seed = (seed * 9301 + 49297) % 233280
    return seed / 233280.0, seed

# Initialize the seed value
seed = 0

# Generate 10 random numbers using the old version of the function
for i in range(10):
    print(old_rand_gen())

# Generate 10 random numbers using the new version of the function
for i in range(10):
    rand_num, seed = new_rand_gen(seed)
    print(rand_num)
```
In the new version of the function, the seed value is passed as an argument to the function and the function returns both the random number and the updated seed value. The caller must then pass the updated seed value to the function on the next call to maintain the sequence of random numbers.

3.  **Class 3: Functions that return a pointer to a static variable.** To deal with this class of thread-unsafe functions, either rewrite the function so that the caller passes the address of the variable in which to store the results or use the lock-and-copy technique.

Example:
We'll use a thread-unsafe function called `get_data()` that returns a pointer to a static buffer containing some data. In a multi-threaded environment, this can lead to data corruption and race conditions.

**Bad case: Thread-unsafe function**

Here's the `get_data()` function, which is thread-unsafe:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char *get_data() {
    static char buffer[256];
    // Fill the buffer with some data
    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "Current data: %d", rand());
    return buffer;
}

void print_data() {
    char *data = get_data();
    printf("Thread data: %s\n", data);
}
```
Imagine two threads, `thread1` and `thread2`, both calling `print_data()`. Since the buffer in `get_data()` is static, the data might be overwritten by one thread before the other thread has a chance to print it, causing unpredictable output.

**Fixed case: Using lock-and-copy approach**

We can fix this by using the lock-and-copy approach with a mutex and a thread-safe wrapper function:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

char *get_data_unsafe() {
    static char buffer[256];
    // Fill the buffer with some data
    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "Current data: %d", rand());
    return buffer;
}

void get_data_safe(char *dst, size_t size) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    char *src = get_data_unsafe();
    strncpy(dst, src, size - 1);
    dst[size - 1] = '\0';
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
}

void print_data() {
    char data[256];
    get_data_safe(data, sizeof(data));
    printf("Thread data: %s\n", data);
}
```
In this fixed version, we introduced a mutex and a thread-safe wrapper function `get_data_safe()`. This function locks the mutex, calls the thread-unsafe `get_data_unsafe()` function, copies the result into the provided destination buffer, and then unlocks the mutex. Now, when multiple threads call `print_data()`, the output will be correct and predictable since the lock-and-copy approach prevents data corruption and race conditions.

4.  **Class 4: Functions that call thread-unsafe functions.** These functions can still be thread-safe if you protect the call site and any resulting shared data with a mutex, or by modifying the thread-unsafe function being called.
Consider a simple thread-unsafe function `count_words` that takes a string and returns the number of words in the string. It uses a shared static variable `word_count` to store the count of words.
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>

static int word_count;

bool is_whitespace(char c) {
    return c == ' ' || c == '\t' || c == '\n';
}

int count_words(const char *str) {
    word_count = 0;
    bool in_word = false;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {
        if (!is_whitespace(str[i])) {
            if (!in_word) {
                in_word = true;
                word_count++;
            }
        } else {
            in_word = false;
        }
    }
    return word_count;
}
```
Now, let's write a thread-safe function `count_words_safe` that calls `count_words`. We will use a mutex to protect the call site and shared data.

```c
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t count_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

int count_words_safe(const char *str) {
    int result;
    
    pthread_mutex_lock(&count_mutex);
    result = count_words(str);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&count_mutex);

    return result;
}
```
In the example above, we have a thread-safe function `count_words_safe` that calls the thread-unsafe function `count_words`. We use a mutex to ensure that only one thread can access the shared data (i.e., the `word_count` variable) at a time, making the `count_words_safe` function thread-safe.
## How can you make a Class 1 thread-unsafe function thread-safe?

To make a Class 1 thread-unsafe function thread-safe, protect the shared variables with synchronization operations, such as P and V. This doesn't require any changes to the calling program but may slow down the function due to the synchronization operations.
