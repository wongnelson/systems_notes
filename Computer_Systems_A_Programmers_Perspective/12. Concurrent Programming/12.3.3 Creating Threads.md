## How do you create threads using pthread_create?

Threads create other threads by calling the `pthread_create` function:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
typedef void *(func)(void *);
int pthread_create(pthread_t *tid, pthread_attr_t *attr, func *f, void *arg);
```
`pthread_create` returns 0 if successful and nonzero on error.

## What are the parameters of pthread_create?

-   `tid`: A pointer to a `pthread_t` variable that will store the ID of the newly created thread.
-   `attr`: A pointer to a `pthread_attr_t` structure for changing the default attributes of the new thread. In most examples, you'll call `pthread_create` with a NULL `attr` argument.
-   `f`: A pointer to the function that will be the thread routine, running in the context of the new thread.
-   `arg`: A pointer to the input argument that will be passed to the thread routine.

## How can a thread determine its own thread ID?

A thread can determine its own thread ID by calling the `pthread_self` function:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
pthread_t pthread_self(void);
```
`pthread_self` returns the thread ID of the caller.

## Example
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void *print_thread_id(void *arg) {
  printf("Thread ID: %ld\n", pthread_self());
  return NULL;
}

int main(void) {
  pthread_t thread_id;
  int rc;

  rc = pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, print_thread_id, NULL);
  if (rc) {
    printf("Error creating thread\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  printf("Main thread ID: %ld\n", pthread_self());

  pthread_exit(NULL);
  return 0;
}
```
This code creates a new thread using `pthread_create`, and the newly created thread calls `pthread_self` to print its own thread ID. The main thread also calls `pthread_self` to print its own thread ID.
