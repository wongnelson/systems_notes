## What is the thread execution model?
### What is the main thread in a process?

The main thread is the initial thread created when a process starts.

### How does the main thread create a peer thread?

The main thread creates a peer thread through a function call, such as pthread_create in a POSIX-compliant operating system.

### How do multiple threads run concurrently?

Multiple threads run concurrently by interleaving their execution. The operating system schedules each thread to run for a certain amount of time on a single processor core, and then switches to another thread. This process repeats, allowing multiple threads to run in parallel on a single processor core

### What causes a context switch between threads?

A context switch between threads can occur due to slow system calls or system interval timer interruptions. During a context switch, the operating system saves the current execution context of the running thread and restores the saved context of another thread.

## How do thread context switches differ from process context switches?

Thread context switches are faster than process context switches because a thread context is smaller than a process context. When switching between threads, the system only needs to change the thread-specific information, such as the program counter, stack pointer, and registers. Since threads share the same address space and resources, the system does not need to switch these components during a thread context switch.

## How are threads organized in comparison to processes?

Unlike processes, threads are not organized in a rigid parent-child hierarchy. Instead, the threads associated with a process form a pool of peers, independent of which threads were created by other threads. The main thread is distinguished from other threads only because it is always the first thread to run in the process. This pool of peers allows a thread to kill any of its peers or wait for any of its peers to terminate, and each peer can read and write the same shared data.

## Can you provide an example of a concurrent thread execution model?

Consider the following example of concurrent thread execution:
`Thread 1 (main thread)  ->  Thread context switch  ->  Thread 2 (peer thread)`
In this example, the main thread (Thread 1) creates a peer thread (Thread 2). Control passes between the threads via context switches, and they run concurrently. The diagram in Figure 12.12 below illustrates this progression over time, showing the pattern of control passing between the main thread and the peer thread within the thread context switch.
