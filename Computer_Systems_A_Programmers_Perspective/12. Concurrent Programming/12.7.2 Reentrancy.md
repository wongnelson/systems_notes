## What are reentrant functions?

Reentrant functions are a specific class of thread-safe functions that do not reference any shared data when they are called by multiple threads. They are typically more efficient than non-reentrant thread-safe functions because they require no synchronization operations.

## How do reentrant functions relate to thread-safe and thread-unsafe functions?

The set of all functions can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: thread-safe functions and thread-unsafe functions. The set of reentrant functions is a proper subset of the thread-safe functions.

## What are the advantages of reentrant functions?

Reentrant functions are more efficient than non-reentrant thread-safe functions because they don't require synchronization operations. Additionally, the only way to convert a class 2 thread-unsafe function into a thread-safe one is to rewrite it so that it is reentrant.

## How can you identify a reentrant function?

If all function arguments are passed by value (no pointers) and all data references are to local automatic stack variables (no references to static or global variables), then the function is explicitly reentrant. If some parameters are passed by reference (i.e., pointers) but the calling threads pass pointers to nonshared data, then the function is implicitly reentrant. Reentrancy is sometimes a property of both the caller and the callee, not just the callee alone.

## Can you provide an example of converting a thread-unsafe function into a reentrant function?

Consider the `rand` function from the previous example:
```c
unsigned next_seed = 1;

unsigned rand(void) {
    next_seed = next_seed * 1103515245 + 12345;
    return (unsigned)(next_seed >> 16) % 32768;
}
```
This function is thread-unsafe because it uses a static variable `next_seed`. We can rewrite it as a reentrant function by replacing the static variable with a pointer passed in by the caller:
```c
int rand_r(unsigned int *nextp) {
    *nextp = *nextp * 1103515245 + 12345;
    return (unsigned int)(*nextp / 65536) % 32768;
}
```
The reentrant version, `rand_r`, is implicitly reentrant, as it relies on the caller to pass a pointer to nonshared data.

## What's  an example of a thread safe but not reentrant function
Let's consider a simple example: a thread-safe function to increment a global counter but not reentrant because it uses a global variable and synchronization primitives.

Here's the code for the function:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

unsigned int counter = 0;
pthread_mutex_t counter_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void increment_counter() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&counter_mutex);
    counter++;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&counter_mutex);
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread1, thread2;

    pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, (void *)increment_counter, NULL);
    pthread_create(&thread2, NULL, (void *)increment_counter, NULL);

    pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread2, NULL);

    printf("Counter: %u\n", counter);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `increment_counter` function is thread-safe because it uses a mutex to protect access to the shared global variable `counter`. However, it is not reentrant because it relies on the global variable `counter` and the synchronization primitive `counter_mutex`. If this function is called from within itself or indirectly through another function in a reentrant context, it may lead to a deadlock due to the mutex.
