## What is the readers-writers problem?

The readers-writers problem is a generalization of the mutual exclusion problem. It involves a collection of concurrent threads accessing a shared object, such as a data structure in main memory or a database on disk. Some threads only read the object (readers), while others modify it (writers). Writers must have exclusive access to the object, but readers may share the object with an unlimited number of other readers. In general, there are an unbounded number of concurrent readers and writers.

### Can you provide some real-life examples of the readers-writers problem?

Readers-writers interactions occur frequently in real systems. For example:

1.  In an online airline reservation system, an unlimited number of customers are allowed to concurrently inspect the seat assignments, but a customer who is booking a seat must have exclusive access to the database.
2.  In a multithreaded caching web proxy, an unlimited number of threads can fetch existing pages from the shared page cache, but any thread that writes a new page to the cache must have exclusive access.

### What are the variations of the readers-writers problem?

The readers-writers problem has several variations, each based on the priorities of readers and writers:

1.  The first readers-writers problem, which favors readers, requires that no reader be kept waiting unless a writer has already been granted permission to use the object. In other words, no reader should wait simply because a writer is waiting.
2.  The second readers-writers problem, which favors writers, requires that once a writer is ready to write, it performs its write as soon as possible. Unlike the first problem, a reader that arrives after a writer must wait, even if the writer is also waiting.
3. The third reader-writers problem, which favors neither readers nor writers, requires that a reader can only be granted permission to read the object if there are no writers waiting to write. If a writer is ready to write, it will be granted permission to write as soon as possible, but it may have to wait if there are active readers. This solution aims to balance the needs of readers and writers by ensuring that writers are not starved and that readers are not kept waiting unnecessarily.

### What is a potential issue with solutions to the readers-writers problems?

A correct solution to either of the readers-writers problems can result in starvation, where a thread blocks indefinitely and fails to make progress. For example, in a solution that favors readers, a writer could wait indefinitely while a stream of readers arrived.

### How does the solution to the first readers-writers problem work?

The solution to the first readers-writers problem uses two semaphores:

1.  `w`: Controls access to the critical sections that access the shared object.
2.  `mutex`: Protects access to the shared `readcnt` variable, which counts the number of readers currently in the critical section.

A writer locks the `w` mutex each time it enters the critical section and unlocks it each time it leaves, guaranteeing that there is at most one writer in the critical section at any point in time. On the other hand, only the first reader to enter the critical section locks `w`, and only the last reader to leave the critical section unlocks it. The `w` mutex is ignored by readers who enter and leave while other readers are present. This means that as long as a single reader holds the `w` mutex, an unbounded number of readers can enter the critical section unimpeded.

## 12.10
Q: The solution to the first readers-writers problem in Figure 12.26 gives priority to readers, but this priority is weak in the sense that a writer leaving its critical section might restart a waiting writer instead of a waiting reader. Describe a scenario where this weak priority would allow a collection of writers to starve a reader.

A: 
Imagine a scenario with multiple writers and a reader. Let's assume that the writers are continuously producing new data, while the reader is trying to access the shared object.

1.  Writer A enters the critical section and starts writing. Reader R and multiple other writers (B, C, D, ...) are waiting to access the shared object.
2.  Writer A finishes and leaves the critical section. Since the priority in this solution is weak, it's possible that Writer B enters the critical section next, even though Reader R has been waiting.
3.  Writer B finishes and leaves the critical section, but now Writer C enters, again skipping Reader R.
4.  This process continues, with writers continuously entering the critical section, while Reader R keeps waiting.

In this scenario, the weak priority of the solution to the first readers-writers problem allows the writers to starve Reader R, who never gets a chance to access the shared object.
