## What is the problem with waiting for a single I/O event in a concurrent programming scenario?

In a concurrent programming scenario, such as an echo server that must respond to two independent I/O events (a network client making a connection request and a user typing a command line at the keyboard), waiting for a single I/O event is not ideal. If the server waits for a connection request in `accept`, it cannot respond to input commands. Similarly, if it waits for an input command in `read`, it cannot respond to any connection requests.

## What is I/O multiplexing and how does it solve the issue of waiting for multiple I/O events?

I/O multiplexing is a technique that uses the `select` function to ask the kernel to suspend the process, returning control to the application only after one or more I/O events have occurred. This way, the server can wait for multiple I/O events simultaneously, such as waiting for any descriptor in a set to be ready for reading or writing or timing out after a specified duration.

## What is the `select` function, and what are its main components?

The `select` function is a core component of I/O multiplexing. Its main components are:
1.  The `select` function itself:
    
    `int select(int n, fd_set *fdset, NULL, NULL, NULL);`
    
The select function is used to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become ready for some type of I/O operation (e.g. reading or writing). In this case, the select function is used to monitor the file descriptors in the readfds set.

The first argument to select is the highest-numbered file descriptor in any of the sets plus 1. The second argument is a pointer to the readfds set, which is a collection of file descriptors to be monitored for readability. The third and fourth arguments are pointers to sets of file descriptors to be monitored for writeability and for error conditions, respectively, but in this case, they are set to NULL which means we're not interested in writeability and error conditions. The fifth argument is a timeout value, but in this case, it is set to NULL which means that select will block indefinitely until one of the monitored file descriptors becomes ready.

The return value of select is the number of file descriptors that are ready for I/O. This information can then be used to determine which file descriptors are ready, by using the FD_ISSET macro to check the corresponding bits in the set
    
2.  Macros for manipulating descriptor sets:
```c
FD_ZERO(fd_set *fdset);
is a macro that initializes a file descriptor set to have no members. The file descriptor set is passed as an argument to the macro and should be of type `fd_set`. The macro sets all bits of the file descriptor set to 0.

FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set *fdset);
is a macro that removes a file descriptor from a file descriptor set. The first argument to the macro is the file descriptor that you want to remove and the second argument is the file descriptor set to which the file descriptor belongs.

FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *fdset);
`FD_SET` is a macro that adds a file descriptor to a file descriptor set. The first argument to the macro is the file descriptor that you want to add and the second argument is the file descriptor set to which the file descriptor should belong.

FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *fdset);
`FD_ISSET` is a macro that tests whether a file descriptor is a member of a file descriptor set. The first argument to the macro is the file descriptor that you want to test and the second argument is the file descriptor set that you want to test against. The macro returns a non-zero value if the file descriptor is a member of the set, and 0 otherwise.
```

   These macros are used to clear all bits in a descriptor set, clear a specific bit, turn on a specific bit, and check if a bit is on in the descriptor set, respectively.

## How does the fd_set data structure look like?
The `fd_set` data structure is an array of integers, used to represent a set of file descriptors. It is used in the `select` function to wait for events on multiple file descriptors. The size of the `fd_set` data structure is implementation dependent, but typically it is an array of integers of size `FD_SETSIZE`. The `FD_SETSIZE` constant is a macro that defines the maximum number of file descriptors that can be stored in an `fd_set` data structure.

Each bit in the array of integers represents a file descriptor. The value of the file descriptor is obtained by indexing into the array and counting the number of bits set. For example, if `readfds.fds_bits[0]` contains the value `3`, then file descriptors 0 and 1 are members of the set, because `3` in binary is `00000011`.

The `FD_ZERO` macro is used to initialize the `fd_set` data structure so that no file descriptors are members of the set. The `FD_SET` macro is used to add a file descriptor to the set. The `FD_CLR` macro is used to remove a file descriptor from the set. The `FD_ISSET` macro is used to check if a file descriptor is a member of the set.
### Ok, lets say fds_bits[1] has the value 2. the binary is 00000010. Wouldn't descriptors 0 and 1 be members of the set as well?
No, the value 2 in the `fds_bits` array corresponds to the file descriptor 2. The file descriptors 0 and 1 are not part of the set as their corresponding bits are not set to 1.

In the example you mentioned, the binary representation of the value 2 is `00000010`. This means that the second bit is set to 1, which corresponds to the file descriptor 2. The first and third bits are set to 0, which means that file descriptors 0 and 1 are not part of the set.

## What is a descriptor set, and how does it relate to the `select` function?

A descriptor set is a bit vector of size `n`, with each bit `bk` corresponding to descriptor `k`. Descriptor `k` is a member of the descriptor set if and only if `bk = 1`. The `select` function takes a descriptor set (`fdset`) called the read set and the cardinality (`n`) of the read set as inputs. It blocks until at least one descriptor in the read set is ready for reading. The function modifies the `fd_set` pointed to by the `fdset` argument to indicate a subset of the read set called the ready set, which consists of the descriptors in the read set that are ready for reading. The value returned by the function indicates the cardinality of the ready set.
```c
                       +--------------------------+
                       |   Descriptor Set     
                       +--------------------------+
                       | b0 | b1 | b2 | ... | bk-1 |
                       +----+----+----+-----+-----+

b0, b1, b2, ..., bn-1: Bits in the descriptor set, with bk corresponding to descriptor k
1: Descriptor is a member of the descriptor set
0: Descriptor is not a member of the descriptor set

Input to select function:
  - fdset: Descriptor set (read set)
  - n: Cardinality of the read set

Output from select function:
  - Modified fdset: Ready set (subset of read set with descriptors ready for reading)
  - Value returned: Cardinality of the ready set

Example:
  Initial read set (fdset):       1 0 1 0 1  (n = 5)
  After select function:          1 0 0 0 1  (Value returned = 2)
```
Example:

Consider a descriptor set `d` with the size of 5, which can contain the file descriptors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each bit of the descriptor set corresponds to one of the file descriptors. If the bit at index `k` is set to 1, it means that the file descriptor `k` is a member of the set `d`. If the bit is set to 0, it means that the file descriptor `k` is not a member of the set `d`.

For example, if the bits in the descriptor set `d` are `10110`, it means that the file descriptors 2, 3, and 4 are members of the set. If we want to add the file descriptor 0 to the set, we would set the bit at index 0 to 1, so the new set would be `10111`. If we then want to remove the file descriptor 3 from the set, we would set the bit at index 3 to 0, so the new set would be `10101`.

## File descriptors that are not part of the set can still be represented as part of the set. Why?

File descriptors that are not part of the set can still be represented as part of the set for the purpose of tracking their status. For example, during a select() system call, a descriptor set is used to specify which file descriptors the system should monitor for events. The system will monitor all the file descriptors that are members of the set, regardless of whether they are open or not. By representing file descriptors that are not part of the set as part of the set, the system can keep track of the status of all file descriptors, including those that are not currently open or being used. This allows the system to handle file descriptors dynamically and to handle multiple file descriptors at the same time.
