## What is a progress graph and how does it help visualize concurrent threads?
### What is a progress graph?

A progress graph is a visual representation that models the execution of concurrent threads in an n-dimensional Cartesian space. It provides a visual representation of the progress of multiple threads and their interactions.

### How is a progress graph represented?

A progress graph is represented in an n-dimensional Cartesian space, where each axis corresponds to the progress of a specific thread. Points in the space represent the state where each thread has completed a certain instruction. The origin of the graph represents the initial state, where none of the threads have completed any instructions.

### What is the purpose of a progress graph?

The purpose of a progress graph is to help visualize the execution of concurrent threads, their interactions, and possible synchronization issues. It illustrates the instruction execution as transitions between states and helps identify critical sections, safe and unsafe trajectories, and the need for mutual exclusion.

## What's a critical section?
A critical section is a portion of code that must be executed atomically, meaning it should not be interrupted by any other threads or processes. This is necessary in a multithreaded environment to ensure that shared resources, such as data structures or files, are accessed and modified in a consistent and controlled manner. Access to a critical section is typically protected by a synchronization mechanism, such as a lock or a semaphore, to prevent multiple threads from accessing and modifying the shared resources at the same time.

### What does the origin of the progress graph represent?

The origin of the progress graph represents the initial state, where none of the threads have completed any instructions.

```c
           Thread 2
           |
           |
  (S1,U2)  *  Unsafe
      \    |   Region
       \   *  (S1,L2)
        \  | 
         \ *  (L1,L2)
          \|
           +-------------------------
           (H1,H2)    (L1,H2)    (S1,H2)
                 Thread 1
```
-   Each point (x,y) on the graph represents the state where Thread 1 has completed instruction x, and Thread 2 has completed instruction y.
-   The origin (H1,H2) represents the initial state where none of the threads have completed any instructions.
-   The unsafe region in this example is a triangular area where both threads access the shared resource simultaneously. Trajectories that cross this region lead to unsafe execution.
-   Safe trajectories are those that do not enter the unsafe region. In this example, a safe trajectory would be (H1,H2) -> (L1,H2) -> (S1,H2) -> (S1,L2) -> (S1,U2), which skirts the left and top sides of the unsafe region.

## What are critical sections, and why are they important in concurrent programming?

Critical sections are segments of code in which a thread manipulates shared resources or shared variables, like the shared counter in the `badcnt.c` example. It is essential to ensure that these sections do not interleave with the critical sections of other threads. If two or more threads access the shared resource simultaneously without proper synchronization, it can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or incorrect results.

Mutual exclusion is a key concept in concurrent programming that ensures only one thread can execute its critical section at any given time, preventing interleaving and maintaining the integrity of shared resources.

## How do progress graphs represent safe and unsafe trajectories?

In a progress graph, the intersection of critical sections of different threads forms an unsafe region. A trajectory represents the execution history of a program as it moves through the state space.

-   Safe trajectory: A trajectory that avoids the unsafe region entirely is considered safe. It ensures that the threads access shared resources correctly and mutually exclusively, preventing race conditions and synchronization issues.
    
-   Unsafe trajectory: A trajectory that touches or crosses the unsafe region is considered unsafe. It can lead to incorrect results or unpredictable behavior due to the lack of proper synchronization between the threads.
    

Using progress graphs to analyze concurrent programs can help identify potential synchronization problems and guide the implementation of synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores, to guarantee safe trajectories for the threads.
