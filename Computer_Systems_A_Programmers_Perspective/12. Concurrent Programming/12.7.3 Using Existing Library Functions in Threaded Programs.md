## What are some common thread-unsafe library functions and their thread-safe alternatives?

Most Linux functions, including those in the standard C library (e.g., malloc, free, realloc, printf, and scanf), are thread-safe, with a few exceptions. The table below lists some common thread-unsafe library functions, their thread-unsafe class, and their Linux thread-safe counterparts.
| Thread-unsafe function | Thread-unsafe class | Linux thread-safe version |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| rand                   | 2                   | rand_r                     |
| strtok                 | 2                   | strtok_r                   |
| asctime                | 3                   | asctime_r                  |
| ctime                  | 3                   | ctime_r                    |
| gethostbyaddr         | 3                   | gethostbyaddr_r           |
| gethostbyname         | 3                   | gethostbyname_r           |
| inet_ntoa             | 3                   | (none)                     |
| localtime             | 3                   | localtime_r               |


## Why should we avoid the lock-and-copy approach for thread-unsafe functions?

The lock-and-copy approach has several disadvantages when dealing with thread-unsafe functions:

1.  The lock-and-copy approach requires the caller to obtain a lock before calling the function and then release the lock after the function call. This lock acquisition and release overhead can cause the program to run slower, especially if the lock-and-copy approach is used frequently.
    
2.  Functions that return pointers to complex structures, such as linked lists or trees, require the entire structure hierarchy to be copied to ensure thread safety. This deep copy can be expensive in terms of both time and memory, and can make the lock-and-copy approach less efficient than other alternatives.
    
3.  The lock-and-copy approach is designed to work with functions that can be made thread-safe by passing state information in arguments. Class 2 thread-unsafe functions, like `rand`, rely on static state across multiple calls and cannot be made thread-safe using the lock-and-copy approach. To make such functions thread-safe, it may be necessary to use a different approach, such as rewriting the function to use thread-local storage.

## What is the recommended way to handle thread-unsafe functions in threaded programs?

Linux systems provide reentrant versions of most thread-unsafe functions. The names of the reentrant versions always end with the `_r` suffix. For example, the reentrant version of `asctime` is called `asctime_r`. It is recommended to use these reentrant functions whenever possible in threaded programs.
