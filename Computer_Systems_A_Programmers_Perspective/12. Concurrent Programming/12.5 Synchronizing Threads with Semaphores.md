## How do shared variables introduce synchronization errors in threaded programs?

Shared variables can introduce synchronization errors because multiple threads can access and modify the shared variables simultaneously. This can lead to unpredictable results if the operations on the shared variables are not properly synchronized. For example, consider the `badcnt.c` program, which creates two threads that increment a global shared counter variable called `cnt`. When run, the program yields different incorrect results each time due to improper synchronization.

## What is the purpose of semaphores in threaded programs?

Semaphores are used in threaded programs to synchronize access to shared variables, ensuring that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. By synchronizing the access, semaphores help prevent race conditions and other synchronization errors.

## What went wrong in the `badcnt.c` program?

In the `badcnt.c` program, the lack of proper synchronization caused incorrect orderings of the instructions in the two threads, leading to unexpected results. The problem occurs when one thread loads the shared variable `cnt` before the other thread has stored its updated value. Due to this, each thread ends up storing an updated counter value of 1 instead of the expected 2.

## What is a progress graph?

A progress graph is a visual representation of the step-by-step operation of a multi-threaded program, helping to identify correct and incorrect instruction orderings. By analyzing the progress graph, you can determine whether the operating system chooses a correct ordering for your threads and identify potential synchronization issues.

## How can synchronization be improved in the `badcnt.c` program?

Synchronization in the `badcnt.c` program can be improved by using semaphores or other synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes, to ensure that only one thread can access the shared `cnt` variable at a time. This prevents race conditions and ensures that the increment operations are executed in the correct order, producing the expected results.
