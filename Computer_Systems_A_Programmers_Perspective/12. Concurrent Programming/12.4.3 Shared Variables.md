## What does it mean for a variable to be shared in a threaded program?

A variable `v` is considered shared if and only if one of its instances is referenced by more than one thread.

## Is the variable `cnt` in the example program shared?

Yes, the variable `cnt` in the example program is shared because it has only one run-time instance, and this instance is referenced by both peer threads. Consider the following code snippet:

`static int cnt = 0;

There is only one instance of `cnt`, and both peer threads read and write this instance.

## Is the variable `myid` in the example program shared?

No, the variable `myid` is not shared, because each of its two instances is referenced by exactly one thread. The code snippet below shows the declaration and usage of `myid`:int myid = (int)vargp;

`int myid = (int)vargp;

There are two instances of `myid`, one on the stack of peer thread 0 and the other on the stack of peer thread 1. Each instance is referenced by only one thread.

## Can local automatic variables, like `msgs`, be shared?

Yes, it is important to realize that local automatic variables, such as `msgs`, can also be shared. Even though these variables have separate instances for each thread, it is still possible for multiple threads to reference the same instance under certain circumstances. One example is when a pointer to the variable is passed to another thread. If a pointer to a local automatic variable is passed to another thread, both threads will have access to the same memory location and can read or modify the value stored there.

For example, consider the following code:
```c
void *thread_function(void *arg) {
    int msgs = *((int *)arg);
    // Access the value stored in msgs
    ...
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    int msgs = 42;
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread_function, &msgs);
    // Access the value stored in msgs
    ...
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, both the main thread and the newly created thread have access to the same `msgs` variable. The value stored in `msgs` can be accessed and modified by both threads, which can lead to synchronization and race conditions if both threads attempt to access the same variable simultaneously.

It is important to be aware of this behavior and to use appropriate synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes or semaphores, to manage access to shared variables. This will help to avoid race conditions and other synchronization issues that can occur when multiple threads access the same data.

## 12.6
The main idea here is that stack variables are private, whereas global and static variables are shared. Static variables such as `cnt` are a little tricky because the sharing is limited to the functions within their scope—in this case, the thread routine.
| Instance  | Referenced by main thread? | Referenced by peer thread 0? | Referenced by peer thread 1? |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| ptr       | Yes                        | Yes                          | Yes                           |
| cnt       | No                         | Yes                          | Yes                           |
| i.m       | Yes                        | No                           | No                            |
| msgs.m    | Yes                        | Yes                          | Yes                           |
| myid.p0   | No                         | Yes                          | No                            |
| myid.p1   | No                         | No                           | Yes                           |
1.  Notes:
    
    -   `ptr` A global variable that is written by the main thread and read by the peer threads.
        
    -   `cnt` A static variable with only one instance in memory that is read and written by the two peer threads.
        
    -   `i.m` A local automatic variable stored on the stack of the main thread. Even though its value is passed to the peer threads, the peer threads never reference it on the stack, and thus it is not shared.
        
    -   `msgs.m` A local automatic variable stored on the main thread's stack and referenced indirectly through `ptr` by both peer threads.
        
    -   `myid.p0` and `myid.p1` Instances of a local automatic variable residing on the stacks of peer threads 0 and 1, respectively.
        
2.  Variables `ptr, cnt`, and `msgs` are referenced by more than one thread and thus are shared.
