## What is the thread memory model?

The thread memory model is a structure where a pool of concurrent threads runs in the context of a process. Each thread has its own separate thread context, while sharing the rest of the process context with other threads. The thread context includes:

-   Thread ID
-   Stack
-   Stack pointer
-   Program counter
-   Condition codes
-   General-purpose register values

The shared process context includes:

-   User virtual address space (text, data, heap, and shared library code and data)
-   Open files

## Are register values shared between threads?

No, register values are never shared between threads. It is impossible for one thread to read or write the register values of another thread because each thread has its own set of virtual registers, which are used to store temporary data and intermediate results during the execution of the thread.

## Is virtual memory shared between threads?

Yes, virtual memory is always shared between threads. Any thread can access any location in the shared virtual memory. If a thread modifies a memory location, other threads will eventually see the change if they read that location.

## How are thread stacks managed in the memory model?

Thread stacks are contained in the stack area of the virtual address space and are usually accessed independently by their respective threads. However, different thread stacks are not protected from other threads. If a thread acquires a pointer to another thread's stack, it can read and write any part of that stack.

For example, in the following code snippet (12.4), the peer threads reference the contents of the main thread's stack indirectly through the global `ptr` variable:
```c
// ...
char **ptr; /* Global variable */
// ...
char *msgs[N] = {
    "Hello from foo",
    "Hello from bar"
};
// ...
ptr = msgs;
// ...

```
In line 26 of the example program, the peer threads access the main thread's stack through the global `ptr` variable:
```c
printf("[%d]: %s (cnt=%d)\n", myid, ptr[myid], ++cnt);
```
This demonstrates how different thread stacks can be accessed by other threads, even though they are usually accessed independently.
