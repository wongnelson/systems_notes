## What is a race in the context of multithreading?

A race occurs when the correctness of a program depends on one thread reaching point x in its control flow before another thread reaches point y. Races usually occur because programmers assume that threads will take some particular trajectory through the execution state space, forgetting the golden rule that threaded programs must work correctly for any feasible trajectory.

## Can you provide an example of a program with a race condition?

Consider the following example with a race condition:
```c
/* WARNING: This code is buggy! */
#include "csapp.h"
#define N 4

void *thread(void *vargp);

int main()
{
    pthread_t tid[N];
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, &i);
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);
    exit(0);
}

/* Thread routine */
void *thread(void *vargp)
{
    int myid = *((int *)vargp);
    printf("Hello from thread %d\n", myid);
    return NULL;
}
```
When running this program, you may get an incorrect output like:
```c
Hello from thread 1
Hello from thread 3
Hello from thread 2
Hello from thread 3
```

The problem is caused by a race between each peer thread and the main thread. The main thread creates a peer thread and passes a pointer to the local stack variable `i`. At this point, the race is on between the next increment of `i` and the dereferencing and assignment of the argument in the thread routine. If the peer thread executes the assignment before the main thread increments `i`, then the `myid` variable gets the correct ID. Otherwise, it will contain the ID of some other thread.

## How can the race condition in the given example be eliminated?

To eliminate the race, you can dynamically allocate a separate block for each integer ID and pass the thread routine a pointer to this block:
```c

1	#include "csapp.h"
2	#define N 4
3
4	void *thread(void *vargp);
5
6	int main()
7	{
8		pthread_t tid[N];
9		int i, *ptr;
10
11		for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
12			ptr = Malloc(sizeof(int));
13			*ptr = i;
14			Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, ptr);
15		}
16		for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
17			Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);
18		exit(0);
19	}
20
21	/* Thread routine */
22	void *thread(void *vargp)
23	{
24		int myid = *((int *)vargp);
/*
The `Free` function is used to free the memory block after the thread has finished executing. This eliminates the possibility of a race condition occurring because each thread has its own data, and there is no shared data between threads.
*/
25		Free(vargp);
26		printf("Hello from thread %d\n", myid);
27		return NULL;
28	}
# Figure 12.43
```

Now, when running this program, you should get the correct result:
```c
Hello from thread 0
Hello from thread 1
Hello from thread 2
Hello from thread 3
```

The order of the output may not change because of the scheduling policy of the operating system. The scheduling policy determines the order in which threads are executed, and in most systems, the scheduling policy is non-deterministic. This means that the order in which threads are executed is not predictable and can change between different runs of the program.

However, the program eliminates the race condition that would have occurred if the same variable (in this case `myid`) was shared by all threads. By allocating a separate block of memory for each thread and passing a pointer to this block as an argument to the thread routine, each thread has its own copy of the variable. This eliminates the race condition and makes it seem as if the threads are executing sequentially.

## 12.13
In [Figure 12.43](file:///OPS/xhtml/fileP7000497027000000000000000008577.xhtml#P7000497027000000000000000008638), we might be tempted to free the allocated memory block immediately after line 14 in the main thread, instead of freeing it in the peer thread. But this would be a bad idea. Why?
A:
Freeing the allocated memory block immediately after line 14 in the main thread would result in a race condition. The main thread would continue execution while the peer thread has not yet started executing. If the main thread frees the memory block, the peer thread may not have a valid pointer to the memory block when it starts executing, leading to undefined behavior. In this case, it is safer to wait until the peer thread has completed execution and then free the memory block in the peer thread, as shown in the code.

1.  In [Figure 12.43](file:///OPS/xhtml/fileP7000497027000000000000000008577.xhtml#P7000497027000000000000000008638), we eliminated the race by allocating a separate block for each integer ID. Outline a different approach that does not call the `malloc` or `free` functions.
    
2.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

An alternative approach is to pass the integer ID directly as an argument to the thread routine, rather than dynamically allocating a separate block for each ID. This approach would look something like this:
```c
#include "csapp.h"
#define N 4

void *thread(void *vargp);

int main()
{
    pthread_t tid[N];
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, (void *)&i);
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);
    exit(0);
}

/* Thread routine */
void *thread(void *vargp)
{
    int myid = *((int *)vargp);
    printf("Hello from thread %d\n", myid);
    return NULL;
}
```
Advantages of this approach:

-   No need to dynamically allocate and free memory, which can save time and improve efficiency
-   The code is simpler and easier to understand

Disadvantages of this approach:

The issue with this approach is that the integer value is cast to a pointer type, which can cause issues related to pointer and integer size differences. Moreover, it still would not solve the race condition.

This approach might be suitable for small programs or simple cases, but it is generally not recommended for larger, more complex programs where the possibility of race conditions or shared data can cause problems.


A more appropriate alternative solution is to create an array of integer IDs and pass pointers to the elements of the array to the thread routine. This would avoid dynamic memory allocation and still provide correct results:
```c
#include "csapp.h"
#define N 4

void *thread(void *vargp);

int main()
{
    pthread_t tid[N];
    int ids[N];
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        ids[i] = i;
        Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, &ids[i]);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_join(tid[i], NULL);
    exit(0);
}

/* Thread routine */
void *thread(void *vargp)
{
    int myid = *((int *)vargp);
    printf("Hello from thread %d\n", myid);
    return NULL;
}
```
Advantages of this approach:

-   No need to dynamically allocate and free memory, which can save time and improve efficiency.
-   The code is simpler and easier to understand.

Disadvantages of this approach:

-   It uses an array to store the IDs, which may be less efficient if the number of threads is large.
-   The array of IDs needs to be kept in the same scope as the `pthread_t` array, ensuring that the memory remains valid for the duration of the threads' execution.
