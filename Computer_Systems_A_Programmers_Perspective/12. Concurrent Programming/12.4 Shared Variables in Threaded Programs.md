## How does the underlying memory model for threads affect variable sharing in a C program?

### What is the memory model for threads in a C program?

In a C program, when multiple threads are created, they share the same address space, which includes the text (code), data, heap, and shared library segments. However, each thread has its own private stack.

### What parts of the memory can be shared among threads?

Global and heap variables can be shared among threads.

### What parts of the memory are private to each thread?

Each thread has its own private stack, meaning that local (stack) variables cannot be shared among threads.

## How are instances of a variable mapped to memory?

Given the memory model, instances of a variable are mapped to memory as follows:

1.  Global variables: Mapped to the data segment and shared among all threads.
2.  Heap variables: Mapped to the heap segment and shared among threads that have pointers to them.
3.  Local (stack) variables: Mapped to the private stack of each thread and not shared among threads.

## How can we determine if a variable is shared in a threaded program?

A variable is shared if and only if multiple threads reference some instance of the variable. To determine if a variable is shared, we need to analyze the number of threads referencing each of these instances.

## Can you provide an example of a threaded program with shared variables?

Consider the example program in Figure 12.15, which consists of a main thread that creates two peer threads. The main thread passes a unique ID to each peer thread, which uses the ID to print a personalized message along with a count of the total number of times the thread routine has been invoked.

Here is the code for the example program:
```c
#include "csapp.h"
#define N 2
void *thread(void *vargp);

char **ptr; /* Global variable */

int main()
{
    int i;
    pthread_t tid;
    char *msgs[N] = {
        "Hello from foo",
        "Hello from bar"
    };

    ptr = msgs;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        Pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, (void *)i);
    Pthread_exit(NULL);
}

void *thread(void *vargp)
{
    int myid = (int)vargp;
    static int cnt = 0;
    printf("[%d]: %s (cnt=%d)\n", myid, ptr[myid], ++cnt);
    return NULL;
}
```
