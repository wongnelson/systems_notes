## What is a thread?
### What is a thread?

A thread is a logical flow that runs within a single process. It is a lightweight unit of execution that can run concurrently with other threads within the same process.

### What does a thread context include?

A thread context is stored in memory and loaded into a processor when a thread is executed. It includes a unique integer thread ID (TID), stack, stack pointer, program counter, general-purpose registers, and condition codes.

### What is shared among all threads within a single process?

The virtual address space of the process is shared among all threads running within it.

### How are threads scheduled?

Threads are scheduled automatically by the kernel.

## How do threads combine qualities of flows based on processes and I/O multiplexing?

Threads have qualities from both process-based and I/O multiplexing-based logical flows. Similar to processes, threads are scheduled automatically by the kernel and are known to the kernel by an integer ID. Like flows based on I/O multiplexing, multiple threads run in the context of a single process, sharing the entire contents of the process virtual address space, including its code, data, heap, shared libraries, and open files.

## What are the advantages of using threads for concurrent logical flows?

Using threads for concurrent logical flows offers several advantages:

1.  **Automatic scheduling:** Like processes, threads are scheduled automatically by the kernel, which simplifies the implementation of concurrent programs.
2.  **Shared address space:** Since multiple threads run within the context of a single process, they share the entire process virtual address space. This makes it easier for threads to share data and resources, such as open files and shared libraries.
3.  **Reduced overhead:** Threads have lower overhead compared to processes because they share the same address space and resources, resulting in more efficient resource utilization.

## Can you provide an example of a multithreaded program?

Here's an example of a simple multithreaded program using the POSIX threads (pthreads) library in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void *print_hello(void *arg) {
    int thread_num = *((int *)arg);
    printf("Hello from thread %d!\n", thread_num);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    const int NUM_THREADS = 4;
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        int *thread_num = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *thread_num = i;
        if (pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, print_hello, thread_num) != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error creating thread %d\n", i);
            exit(1);
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        if (pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error joining thread %d\n", i);
            exit(1);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This program creates four threads that each print a message to the console. The main thread then waits for all child threads to finish before exiting.
