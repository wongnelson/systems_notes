### What is the problem with the following approach?
```c
connfd = Accept(listenfd, (SA *) &clientaddr, &clientlen);
Pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, &connfd);

void *thread(void *vargp) {
    int connfd = *((int *)vargp);
    â‹®
}
```

The problem with this approach is that it introduces a race condition between the assignment statement in the peer thread and the `accept` statement in the main thread. If the assignment completes after the `accept`, then the local `connfd` variable in the peer thread gets the descriptor number of the next connection. This can result in two threads performing input and output on the same descriptor.

## How to correctly pass the connected descriptor to a peer thread?

To correctly pass the connected descriptor to a peer thread when calling `pthread_create`, you should avoid introducing a race between the assignment statement in the peer thread and the `accept` statement in the main thread. This can be done by assigning each connected descriptor returned by `accept` to its own dynamically allocated memory block.

## How to avoid race conditions when passing connected descriptors to threads?

To avoid race conditions when passing connected descriptors to threads, you should assign each connected descriptor returned by `accept` to its own dynamically allocated memory block.
```c
int *connfd = malloc(sizeof(int));
*connfd = Accept(listenfd, (SA *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);
Pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, connfd);
```

## How to prevent memory leaks in the thread routine?

1.   Detaching a thread means that its resources will be automatically freed when it terminates, without the need for the parent thread to explicitly reap the thread. This eliminates the need for the parent thread to wait for the thread to complete using pthread_join, and allows the resources associated with the thread to be reclaimed as soon as the thread terminates.
``pthread_detach(pthread_self());

2.  Free the memory block allocated by the main thread: Be careful to free the memory block that was allocated by the main thread to store the connected descriptor.

```c
int connfd = *((int *)vargp);
free(vargp);
```
