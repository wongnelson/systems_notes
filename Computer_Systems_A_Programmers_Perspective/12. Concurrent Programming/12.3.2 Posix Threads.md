## What are Posix Threads?

Posix Threads (Pthreads) is a standard interface for manipulating threads in C programs. Adopted in 1995, it is available on all Linux systems. Pthreads defines around 60 functions that allow programs to create, kill, and reap threads, share data safely with peer threads, and notify peers about changes in the system state.

## How do you create a simple Pthreads program?

Consider the following example of a simple Pthreads program (Figure 12.13) which creates a peer thread, prints "Hello, world!\n", and waits for the peer thread to terminate before terminating the process:
```c
1	#include "csapp.h"
2	void *thread(void *vargp);
3	
4	int main()
5	{
6		pthread_t tid;
7		Pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, NULL);
8		Pthread_join(tid, NULL);
9		exit(0);
10	}
11	
12	void *thread(void *vargp) /* Thread routine */
13	{
14		printf("Hello, world!\n");
15		return NULL;
16	}
```
## How do you encapsulate code and local data for a thread?

The code and local data for a thread are encapsulated in a thread routine. Each thread routine takes a single generic pointer as input and returns a generic pointer like ```void *thread(void *vargp)```. To pass multiple arguments to a thread routine, you should put the arguments into a structure and pass a pointer to the structure. If you want the thread routine to return multiple arguments, you can return a pointer to a structure.

Code example:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct {
    int a;
    int b;
} parameters;

typedef struct {
    int sum;
    int diff;
} results;

void *thread_routine(void *vargp) {
    parameters *p = (parameters *)vargp;
    results *r = (results *)malloc(sizeof(results));
    r->sum = p->a + p->b;
    r->diff = p->a - p->b;
    return (void *)r;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    parameters p = {5, 3};
    results *r;
    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread_routine, &p);
    pthread_join(tid, (void **)&r);
    printf("Sum: %d\n", r->sum);
    printf("Difference: %d\n", r->diff);
    free(r);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the structure `parameters` is used to store two integers `a` and `b`, which are passed to the thread routine as a pointer. The structure `results` is used to store the sum and difference of `a` and `b`, which are returned from the thread routine as a pointer. The thread routine calculates the sum and difference of `a` and `b`, stores the values in a `results` structure, and returns a pointer to the structure. The main thread receives the pointer to the `results` structure using the `pthread_join` function, and accesses the sum and difference values.

## What are the main steps in the Pthreads "Hello, world!" program?

1.  Declare a local variable `tid` to store the thread ID of the peer thread (line 6).
2.  Create a new peer thread by calling the `pthread_create` function (line 7). When the call returns, the main thread and the newly created peer thread run concurrently, and `tid` contains the new thread's ID.
3.  The main thread waits for the peer thread to terminate with the call to `pthread_join` in line 8.
4.  The main thread calls `exit` (line 9), which terminates all threads currently running in the process.
5.  The peer thread routine (lines 12âˆ’16) prints a string and then terminates the peer thread by executing the return statement in line 15.
