## What is a concurrent event-driven server based on I/O multiplexing?

A concurrent event-driven server based on I/O multiplexing is a type of server that models logical flows as state machines and uses I/O multiplexing to detect and respond to events. In this type of server, multiple clients can be served concurrently without the need for multi-threading or multi-processing.

Note: JS does this

## What is a state machine?

A state machine is a collection of states, input events, and transitions that map states and input events to states. Each transition maps an (input state, input event) pair to an output state. A self-loop is a transition between the same input and output state. State machines are typically drawn as directed graphs, with nodes representing states, directed arcs representing transitions, and arc labels representing input events. A state machine begins execution in some initial state. Each input event triggers a transition from the current state to the next state.

```c
                    Input Event (E1)
                  +-----------------+
                  |                 |
                  v                 |
Initial State (S1)---->(S2)         |
    |         ^       |             |
    |         |       +---->(S3)    |
    | Input Event (E3)       ^      |
    |         |              |      |
    +---->(S4)               |      |
      ^       |              |      |
      |       +--------------+      |
      |       Input Event (E2)      |
      +-----------------------------+
```

In this example:

1.  There are four states: S1, S2, S3, and S4. The initial state is S1.
2.  There are three input events: E1, E2, and E3.
3.  Directed arcs represent transitions between states:
    -   (S1, E1) -> S2
    -   (S1, E3) -> S4
    -   (S2, E2) -> S3
    -   (S3, E1) -> S1
4.  The self-loop for state S1 with input event E1 is represented by the arrow starting and ending at S1.
5.  The state machine starts executing at the initial state, S1.

## How is a new client added to a concurrent server based on I/O multiplexing?

For each new client `k`, a concurrent server based on I/O multiplexing creates a new state machine `sk` and associates it with the connected descriptor `dk`. The state machine has one state ("waiting for descriptor dk to be ready for reading"), one input event ("descriptor dk is ready for reading"), and one transition ("read a text line from descriptor dk").

## How does the server use I/O multiplexing to detect input events?

The server uses the `select` function to detect the occurrence of input events. As each connected descriptor becomes ready for reading, the server executes the transition for the corresponding state machine, in this case, reading and echoing a text line from the descriptor.

## What are the main components of a concurrent event-driven server based on I/O multiplexing?

The main components of a concurrent event-driven server based on I/O multiplexing are:

1.  `pool` structure: Represents a pool of connected descriptors, active clients, and their read buffers. It contains the following attributes:
    
    -   `clientfd`: An array of file descriptors representing the active clients.
    -   `read_set`: A file descriptor set that contains the descriptors to be monitored for readiness to read.
    -   `maxi`: The highest index in the `clientfd` array of an active client.
    -   `maxfd`: The highest file descriptor value in the `read_set`.
2.  `init_pool(int listenfd, pool *p)` function: Initializes the pool of active clients.
    
    -   `listenfd`: The file descriptor of the listening socket.
    -   `p`: A pointer to the `pool` structure to be initialized.
3.  `add_client(int connfd, pool *p)` function: Adds a new client to the pool of active clients.
    
    -   `connfd`: The file descriptor of the newly connected client.
    -   `p`: A pointer to the `pool` structure representing the active clients.
4.  `check_clients(pool *p)` function: Echoes a text line from each ready connected descriptor.
    
    -   `p`: A pointer to the `pool` structure representing the active clients.

## How does the `init_pool` function initialize the client pool?

The `init_pool` function initializes the client pool by setting all the connected descriptors in the `clientfd` array to `-1` (denoting an available slot), making the set of connected descriptors initially empty. It also sets the listening descriptor as the only descriptor in the `select` read set.

```c
void init_pool(int listenfd, pool *p)
{
    /* Initially, there are no connected descriptors */
    int i;
    p->maxi = -1;
    for (i = 0; i < FD_SETSIZE; i++)
        p->clientfd[i] = -1;

    /* Initially, listenfd is only member of select read set */
    p->maxfd = listenfd;
    FD_ZERO(&p->read_set);
    FD_SET(listenfd, &p->read_set);
}
```
## How does the `add_client` function add a new client to the pool?

The `add_client` function adds a new client to the pool by finding an empty slot in the `clientfd` array, adding the connected descriptor to the array, initializing a corresponding `Rio` read buffer, adding the connected descriptor to the `select` read set, and updating the `maxfd` and `maxi` variables.

```c
void add_client(int connfd, pool *p)
{
    int i;
    p->nready--;
    for (i = 0; i < FD_SETSIZE; i++) 
    { 
        if (p->clientfd[i] < 0) 
        { 
            /* Add connected descriptor to the pool */
            p->clientfd[i] = connfd;
            Rio_readinitb(&p->clientrio[i], connfd);

            /* Add the descriptor to descriptor set */
            FD_SET(connfd, &p->read_set);

            /* Update max descriptor and pool high water mark */
            if (connfd > p->maxfd) 
            {
                p->maxfd = connfd; 
            } 
            if (i > p->maxi) 
            {
                p->maxi = i;
            }
            break; 
        } 
    } 
    if (i == FD_SETSIZE) 
    {
        /* Couldn't find an empty slot */
        app_error("add_client error: Too many clients");
    }
}
```


## How does the `check_clients` function service ready client connections?

The `check_clients` function services ready client connections by iterating through the `clientfd` array and checking if the connected descriptor is ready for reading. If it is, the function reads a text line from the descriptor using `Rio_readlineb`, echoes the line back to the client, and maintains a cumulative count of total bytes received from all clients. If EOF is detected (the client has closed its end of the connection), the function closes the server's end of the connection and removes the descriptor from the pool.

```c
void check_clients(pool *p)
{
    int i, connfd, n;
    char buf[MAXLINE];
    rio_t rio;

    for (i = 0; (i <= p->maxi) && (p->nready > 0); i++) {
        connfd = p->clientfd[i];
        rio = p->clientrio[i];

        /* If the descriptor is ready, echo a text line from it */
        if ((connfd > 0) && (FD_ISSET(connfd, &p->ready_set))) {
            p->nready--;
            if ((n = Rio_readlineb(&rio, buf, MAXLINE)) != 0) {
                byte_cnt += n;
                printf("Server received %d (%d total) bytes on fd %d\n",
                    n, byte_cnt, connfd);
                Rio_writen(connfd, buf, n);
            }

            /* EOF detected, remove descriptor from pool */
            else {
                Close(connfd);
                FD_CLR(connfd, &p->read_set);
                p->clientfd[i] = -1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In terms of the finite state model, the `select` function detects input events, the `add_client` function creates a new logical flow (state machine), and the `check_clients` function performs state transitions by echoing input lines. The `check_clients` function also deletes the state machine when the client has finished sending text lines.
