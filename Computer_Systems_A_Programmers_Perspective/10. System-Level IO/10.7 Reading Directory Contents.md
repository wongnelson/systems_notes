## How can applications read the contents of a directory?

Applications can read the contents of a directory with the `readdir` family of functions.

## What is the opendir function and what does it return?

The `opendir` function takes a pathname and returns a pointer to a directory stream:
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>
DIR *opendir(const char *name);
    // Returns: pointer to handle if OK, NULL on error
```
A stream is an abstraction for an ordered list of items, in this case, a list of directory entries.

## How can you read the next directory entry in a directory stream?

A directory stream is a stream of directory entries, similar to how a file stream is a stream of bytes. It represents an open directory and allows you to read the contents of the directory one entry at a time, by calling the `readdir` function 

```c
#include <dirent.h>
struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);
    // Returns: pointer to next directory entry if OK, NULL if no more entries or error
```
Each call to `readdir` returns a pointer to the next directory entry in the stream `dirp`, or `NULL` if there are no more entries.

## What is the structure of a directory entry?

Each directory entry is a structure of the form:
```c
struct dirent {
    ino_t d_ino;      /* inode number */
    char d_name[256]; /* Filename */
};
```
The `d_name` member is the filename, and `d_ino` is the file location.

## How can you distinguish an error from the end-of-stream condition when using readdir?

On error, `readdir` returns `NULL` and sets `errno`. Unfortunately, the only way to distinguish an error from the end-of-stream condition is to check if `errno` has been modified since the call to `readdir`.

## How can you close a directory stream?

You can close a directory stream using the `closedir` function:
```c
#include <dirent.h>
int closedir(DIR *dirp);
    // Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
```
## Can you provide an example of using readdir to read the contents of a directory?

Here is an example of using `readdir` to read the contents of a directory:
```c
#include "csapp.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    DIR *streamp;
    struct dirent *dep;

The line `streamp = opendir(argv[1]);` opens the directory specified by `argv[1]` and returns a pointer to a `DIR` structure, which is stored in the variable `streamp`. The `opendir` function is used to initiate a directory stream and is defined in the header file `<dirent.h>`. A directory stream represents a sequence of directory entries. The `argv[1]` argument specifies the name of the directory that the program intends to access.
    streamp = Opendir(argv[1]);

    errno = 0;
    while ((dep = readdir(streamp)) != NULL) {
        printf("Found file: %s\n", dep->d_name);
    }
    if (errno != 0)
        unix_error("readdir error");

    Closedir(streamp);
    exit(0);
}
```
This code snippet reads the contents of a directory, printing the name of each file found.
