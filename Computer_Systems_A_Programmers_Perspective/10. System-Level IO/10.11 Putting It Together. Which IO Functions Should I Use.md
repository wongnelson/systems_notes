## What is the relationship between Unix I/O, standard I/O, and Rio?

### What are the functions available for Unix I/O?

The functions available for Unix I/O include `open`, `close`, `lseek`, `read`, `write`, and `stat`.

### What are Rio and Standard I/O functions?

The Rio and Standard I/O functions are higher-level I/O functions implemented using the Unix I/O functions.

### What are Rio functions?

Rio functions are robust wrappers for the `read` and `write` functions. They were developed specifically for a textbook and automatically deal with short counts and provide an efficient buffered approach for reading text lines.

### What do Standard I/O functions provide?

Standard I/O functions provide a more complete buffered alternative to the Unix I/O functions, including formatted I/O routines such as `printf` and `scanf`.

## Which I/O functions should be used in programs?

Here are some basic guidelines:

### G1: Use standard I/O functions whenever possible

The standard I/O functions are the method of choice for I/O on disk and terminal devices. Most C programmers use standard I/O exclusively throughout their careers, never bothering with the lower-level Unix I/O functions (except possibly stat, which has no counterpart in the standard I/O library). Whenever possible, it is recommended that you use standard I/O functions.

### G2: Don't use scanf or rio_readlineb to read binary files

Functions like scanf and rio_readlineb are designed specifically for reading text files. A common error that students make is to use these functions to read binary data, causing their programs to fail in strange and unpredictable ways. For example, binary files might be littered with many 0xa bytes that have nothing to do with terminating text lines.

### G3: Use the Rio functions for I/O on network sockets

### What are the problems with using standard I/O for input and output on networks?

Standard I/O poses problems when used for input and output on networks due to poorly documented restrictions on streams that interact badly with restrictions on sockets.

### What is the recommended alternative to standard I/O for input and output on network sockets?

The recommended alternative to standard I/O for input and output on network sockets is to use the robust Rio functions.

### How to use Rio functions for formatted output?

To use Rio functions for formatted output, one can use the `sprintf` function to format a string in memory, and then send it to the socket using `rio_writen`.

### How to use Rio functions for formatted input?

To use Rio functions for formatted input, one can use `rio_readlineb` to read an entire text line and then use `sscanf` to extract different fields from the text line.

## What are the restrictions on standard I/O when using network sockets?

There are two main restrictions on standard I/O streams that interact badly with restrictions on sockets:

### Restriction 1: Input functions following output functions

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">An input function cannot follow an output function without an intervening call to fflush, fseek, fsetpos, or rewind</mark>. The fflush function empties the buffer associated with a stream. The latter three functions use the Unix I/O lseek function to reset the current file position.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fp;
  int c;

  fp = fopen("file.txt", "w");
  fprintf(fp, "Hello World");
  fclose(fp);

  fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  c = getc(fp);
  printf("%c\n", c);

  // without an intervening call to fseek, fsetpos, or rewind,
  // the following line will not work as expected
  fprintf(fp, "Goodbye World");

  fclose(fp);
  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we are opening the file "file.txt" in write mode, writing the string "Hello World" to the file and then closing it. After that, we are opening the same file in read mode and reading the first character using the `getc` function. But if we try to write to the file again, the output will not work as expected because an input function (`getc`) has been called after the output function (`fprintf`) without an intervening call to `fflush`, `fseek`, `fsetpos`, or `rewind`. To avoid this restriction, we can add a call to `fflush` or close the file and reopen it in write mode.

Here's an updated version of the code that includes a call to `fseek` to position the file pointer correctly:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fp;
  int c;

  fp = fopen("file.txt", "w");
  fprintf(fp, "Hello World");
  fclose(fp);

  fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  c = getc(fp);
  printf("%c\n", c);

  // Position the file pointer at the end of the file
  fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);

  fprintf(fp, "Goodbye World");

  fclose(fp);
  return 0;
}
```

In this updated code, after reading the character from the file using `getc`, we call `fseek` to position the file pointer at the end of the file using `SEEK_END`. This ensures that the subsequent output operation with `fprintf` starts writing at the end of the file rather than overwriting the existing content.

By including the `fseek` call, the code will work as expected and append the "Goodbye World" string to the existing content in the file.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink:</mark>
The statement pertains to file handling in C programming language. It highlights a requirement to ensure proper handling and synchronization when switching between reading from and writing to a file.

In C, when you open a file for both reading and writing using a file stream, there are certain restrictions on the sequence of operations you can perform on the file. Specifically, if you perform an output operation (such as writing to the file) and then intend to perform an input operation (such as reading from the file), you need to include an intermediate call to one of the following functions: fflush, fseek, fsetpos, or rewind.

1. fflush: The fflush function is used to flush the output buffer associated with a file stream. It ensures that any data in the output buffer is written to the file before performing any subsequent input operations.

2. fseek, fsetpos, rewind: These functions are used to reposition the file position indicator within the file stream. By calling one of these functions, you can set the file position indicator to the appropriate position for subsequent input operations.

The purpose of including an intervening call to one of these functions is to ensure that the file stream is in the correct state and that any necessary internal adjustments are made before switching between output and input operations. This synchronization step helps prevent unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies when reading from or writing to the file.

### Restriction 2: Output functions following input functions

#### What is the issue with using standard I/O for network applications?

An output function cannot follow an input function without an intervening call to fseek, fsetpos, or rewind, unless the input function encounters an end-of-file. This restriction poses a problem for network applications because it is illegal to use the lseek function on a socket.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    FILE *fp = fdopen(sockfd, "r+");
    fprintf(fp, "Message to be sent\n");
    char buffer[100];
    fscanf(fp, "%s", buffer);
    printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we first create a socket `sockfd` using the `socket` function. Then, we use the `fdopen` function to associate a `FILE` stream with the socket descriptor. The `fprintf` function is used to write a message to the socket, and the `fscanf` function is used to read a message from the socket.

However, this code will not work as expected because the input function `fscanf` cannot follow the output function `fprintf` without an intervening call to `fseek`, `fsetpos`, or `rewind`. This is because the underlying socket is not seekable, and it is illegal to use the `lseek` function on a socket.

To work around this restriction, one option is to use separate `FILE` streams for reading and writing on the same socket. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    FILE *fp_write = fdopen(dup(sockfd), "w");
    FILE *fp_read = fdopen(sockfd, "r");
    fprintf(fp_write, "Message to be sent\n");
    char buffer[100];
    fscanf(fp_read, "%s", buffer);
    printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```
In this modified example, we create two separate `FILE` streams, `fp_write` and `fp_read`, by using the `dup` function to duplicate the socket descriptor. This allows us to use the `fprintf` function to write to the socket, and the `fscanf` function to read from the socket, without encountering the restriction on input and output functions.

#### How can the restrictions of standard I/O be worked around for network applications?

The first restriction can be worked around by adopting a discipline of flushing the buffer before every input operation. The second restriction can only be worked around by opening two streams on the same open socket descriptor, one for reading and one for writing.

```c
FILE *fpin, *fpout;
fpin = fdopen(sockfd, "r");
fpout = fdopen(sockfd, "w");
```
This approach has problems as well, because it requires the application to call fclose on both streams in order to free the memory resources associated with each stream and avoid a memory leak:
```c
fclose(fpin);
fclose(fpout);
```
Each of these operations attempts to close the same underlying socket descriptor, so the second close operation will fail. This is not a problem for sequential programs, but closing an already closed descriptor in a threaded program is a recipe for disaster (see Section 12.7.4).

## What is the recommended approach for I/O on network sockets?

It is recommended that you not use the standard I/O functions for input and output on network sockets. Instead, use the robust Rio functions. If you need formatted output, use the sprintf function to format a string in memory, and then send it to the socket using rio_writen. If you need formatted input, use rio_readlineb to read an entire text line, and then use sscanf to extract different fields from the text line.
