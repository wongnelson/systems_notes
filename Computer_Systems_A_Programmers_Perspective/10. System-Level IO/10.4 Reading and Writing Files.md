## How do applications perform input and output with files?

Applications perform input and output by calling the `read` and `write` functions, respectively:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t n);
    // Returns: number of bytes read if OK, 0 on EOF, -1 on error

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t n);
    // Returns: number of bytes written if OK, -1 on error
```

## How can applications modify the current file position?
## Why do read and write sometimes transfer fewer bytes than requested?

In some situations, `read` and `write` transfer fewer bytes than the application requests. Such short counts do not indicate an error. They occur for a number of reasons:

1.  Encountering EOF on reads: When reading from a file, the `read` function may return fewer bytes than requested if the end-of-file (EOF) marker is encountered. The EOF marker is a special character that indicates the end of the file has been reached. When the `read` function encounters the EOF marker, it returns 0 to indicate that no more data is available.
    
2.  Reading text lines from a terminal: When reading from a terminal, the `read` function may return fewer bytes than requested if the user presses the enter key. In this case, the `read` function returns the number of bytes read up until the enter key was pressed, which may be less than the number of bytes requested.
    
3.  Reading and writing network sockets: When reading or writing data over a network, the `read` and `write` functions may transfer fewer bytes than requested due to network congestion, limited buffer space, or other reasons. This can result in short counts, where the actual number of bytes transferred is less than the number of bytes requested.

## What is the difference between ssize_t and size_t?

On x86-64 systems, a `size_t` is defined as an unsigned long, and an `ssize_t` (signed size) is defined as a long. The `read` function returns a signed size rather than an unsigned size because it must return a -1 on error. Interestingly, the possibility of returning a single -1 reduces the maximum size of a read by a factor of 2.

## How should applications handle short counts in read and write operations?

In practice, you will never encounter short counts when you read from disk files except on EOF, and you will never encounter short counts when you write to disk files. However, if you want to build robust (reliable) network applications such as Web servers, you must deal with short counts by repeatedly calling `read` and `write` until all requested bytes have been transferred.
