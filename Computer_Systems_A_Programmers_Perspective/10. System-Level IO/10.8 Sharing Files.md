## What are the three data structures used by the Linux kernel to represent open files?

The kernel represents open files using three related data structures:

1.  Descriptor table
2.  File table
3.  v-node table

## What is the Descriptor table, and what does it represent?

Each process has its own separate descriptor table whose entries are indexed by the process's open file descriptors. Each open descriptor entry points to an entry in the file table.

## What is the File table, and what does it represent?

The set of open files is represented by a file table that is shared by all processes. Each file table entry consists of the current file position, a reference count of the number of descriptor entries that currently point to it, and a pointer to an entry in the v-node table. Closing a descriptor decrements the reference count in the associated file table entry. The kernel will not delete the file table entry until its reference count is zero.

## What is the v-node table, and what does it represent?

Like the file table, the v-node table is shared by all processes. Each entry contains most of the information in the `stat` structure, including the `st_mode` and `st_size` members.

#### does each descriptor table entry only handle one fd?
Yes, each Descriptor table entry typically corresponds to a single file descriptor (fd) in a process. The Descriptor table maintains a mapping between the file descriptor and the underlying operating system resource, such as a file or socket.

Each file descriptor in a process is unique, and its value is typically an integer that corresponds to an index in the Descriptor table array. When a new file descriptor is created in a process, a new entry is added to the Descriptor table, and the corresponding index is returned as the value of the file descriptor.

In most operating systems, file descriptors are managed at the process level, which means that each process has its own Descriptor table. This allows multiple processes to independently access and manage their own file descriptors and operating system resources, while maintaining separation and isolation between them.

#### does each fd only pair to one v-node entry?
In most operating systems, each file descriptor (fd) in a process typically corresponds to one v-node entry in the file system's v-node table. A v-node, or virtual node, is a data structure used by the operating system to represent a file or directory in the file system.

When a process opens a file or directory using a file descriptor, the operating system creates a new entry in the process's Descriptor table and a new v-node entry in the file system's v-node table. The file descriptor then points to the v-node entry, which contains information about the file or directory, such as its location on disk, access permissions, and other attributes.

Each v-node entry typically corresponds to one file or directory in the file system, although some operating systems may use multiple v-nodes for a single file or directory in certain situations, such as when the file is accessed with different permissions or from different processes.

## How can multiple descriptors reference the same file through different file table entries?

![[Pasted image 20230409134844.png]]
### Figure 10.13 File sharing.
The example shows two descriptors sharing the same disk file through two open file table entries

Multiple descriptors can reference the same file through different file table entries, as shown in Figure 10.13. This might happen, for example, if you were to call the `open` function twice with the same filename. The key idea is that each descriptor has its own distinct file position, so different reads on different descriptors can fetch data from different locations in the file.

## How do parent and child processes share files?

Suppose that before a call to `fork`, the parent process has the open files shown in Figure 10.12. Then Figure 10.14 shows the situation after the call to `fork`.
![[Pasted image 20230409140646.png]]
### Figure 10.14 How a child process inherits the parent's open files.

The child gets its own duplicate copy of the parent's descriptor table. Parent and child share the same set of open file tables and thus share the same file position. An important consequence is that the parent and child must both close their descriptors before the kernel will delete the corresponding file table

## 10.2
1.  Suppose the disk file `foobar.txt` consists of the six ASCII characters `foobar`. Then what is the output of the following program?
    
    ```
    
    1	#include "csapp.h"
    2	
    3	int main()
    4	{
    5		int fd1, fd2;
    6		char c;
    7	
    8		fd1 = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    9		fd2 = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    10		Read(fd1, &c, 1);
    11		Read(fd2, &c, 1);
    12		printf("c = %c\n", c);
    13		exit(0);
    14	}
    ```
A:
The descriptors `fd1` and `fd2` each have their own open file table entry, so each descriptor has its own file position for `foobar.txt`. Thus, the read from `fd2` reads the first byte of `foobar.txt`, and the output is

```

c = f
```

## 10.3
As before, suppose the disk file `foobar.txt` consists of the six ASCII characters `foobar`. Then what is the output of the following program?

```

1	#include "csapp.h"
2	
3	int main()
4	{
5		int fd;
6		char c;
7	
8		fd = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
9		if (Fork() == 0) {
10			Read(fd, &c, 1);
11			exit(0);
12		}
13		Wait(NULL);
14		Read(fd, &c, 1);
15		printf("c = %c\n", c);
16		exit(0);
17	}
```

Recall that the child inherits the parent's descriptor table and that all processes shared the same open file table. Thus, the descriptor `fd` in both the parent and child points to the same open file table entry. When the child reads the first byte of the file, the file position increases by 1. Thus, the parent reads the second byte, and the output is

```
c = o
```
