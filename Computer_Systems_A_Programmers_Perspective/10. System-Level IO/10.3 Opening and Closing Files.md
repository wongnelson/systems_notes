## How can a process open or create a file?

A process opens an existing file or creates a new file by calling the `open` function:
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int open(char *filename, int flags, mode_t mode);
    // Returns: new file descriptor if OK, -1 on error
```
The `open` function converts a filename to a file descriptor and returns the descriptor number. The descriptor returned is always the smallest descriptor that is not currently open in the process.

## What are the possible flags for the open function in Linux?

The `flags` argument in the `open` function indicates how the process intends to access the file:

-   `O_RDONLY`: Reading only
-   `O_WRONLY`: Writing only
-   `O_RDWR`: Reading and writing

## How can additional instructions for writing be provided?

The `flags` argument can also be OR-ed with one or more bit masks that provide additional instructions for writing:

-   `O_CREAT`: If the file doesn't exist, then create a truncated (empty) version of it.
-   `O_TRUNC`: If the file already exists, then truncate it.
-   `O_APPEND`: Before each write operation, set the file position to the end of the file.

## What are the access permission bits in Linux?

Access permission bits are shown in Figure 10.2:

-   `S_IRUSR`: User (owner) can read this file
-   `S_IWUSR`: User (owner) can write this file
-   `S_IXUSR`: User (owner) can execute this file
-   `S_IRGRP`: Members of the owner's group can read this file
-   `S_IWGRP`: Members of the owner's group can write this file
-   `S_IXGRP`: Members of the owner's group can execute this file
-   `S_IROTH`: Others (anyone) can read this file
-   `S_IWOTH`: Others (anyone) can write this file
-   `S_IXOTH`: Others (anyone) can execute this file

## How does umask affect the access permission bits of a new file?

In Unix-like operating systems, the `umask` is a permission mask that is used to control the default permissions assigned to newly created files and directories. It is a 3-digit octal number that represents the permissions that should be turned off for the newly created files.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Suppose that you have a process with a umask of `0022`. This umask value means that new files created by this process should not have write permissions for the "group" and "others".</mark>

Let's say that the process wants to create a file with the open function, and it provides a mode of `0777`. This mode value, in the absence of a umask, would grant read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.

However, the umask value of `0022` will affect the final permissions of the file. Here's how you can calculate the final permissions:

1. Compute the complement of the umask: `~0022`. In binary, `0022` is `000 010 010`. The complement of this is `111 101 101`, which is `1755` in octal.

2. Perform a bitwise AND operation with the mode and the complement of the umask: `0777 & ~0022` or `0777 & 1755`.

3. In binary, `0777` is `111 111 111` and `1755` is `111 101 101`. Performing the bitwise AND operation gives `111 101 101`, which is `0755` in octal.

Therefore, the final permissions of the file will be `0755`, which means:

- Owner (User): Read, write, and execute permissions (7 in octal)
- Group: Read and execute permissions (5 in octal)
- Others: Read and execute permissions (5 in octal)

The umask has effectively removed the write permissions for the group and others from the initial mode of `0777`, which is its intended purpose.

In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, permissions are represented as a set of three numbers (e.g., 755, 644, 777) where each number, ranging from 0 to 7, is an octal representation of 3 binary bits. These 3 bits correspond to the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the owner/user, group, and others, respectively. 

When you break down the binary representation, each bit stands for:

- 4 stands for 'read'
- 2 stands for 'write'
- 1 stands for 'execute'

So, a permission of 7 (in octal) means 'read', 'write', and 'execute' (4+2+1). A permission of 5 means 'read' and 'execute' (4+1). A permission of 6 means 'read' and 'write' (4+2).

Therefore, in an octal permission like 755:

- The first 7 stands for 'read', 'write', 'execute' permissions for the owner/user.
- The second 5 stands for 'read', 'execute' permissions for the group.
- The third 5 stands for 'read', 'execute' permissions for others.

When you set a umask, it essentially masks the permission bits that you do not want the file to have. A umask of 0022, in binary, is 000 010 010. This means:

- No permissions are masked for the owner/user.
- Write permission (2) is masked for the group.
- Write permission (2) is masked for others.

This results in new files created by the process having read and write permissions for the owner/user, and only read permissions for the group and others. So, umask 0022 essentially ensures that new files cannot be written to by anyone other than the owner/user.

## How can a process close an open file?

A process closes an open file by calling the `close` function:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int close(int fd);
    // Returns: 0 if OK, -1 on error
```
Closing a descriptor that is already closed is an error.


## 10.1
1.  What is the output of the following program?
    
    ```c
    
    1	#include "csapp.h"
    2	
    3	int main()
    4	{
    5		int fd1, fd2;
    6	
    7		fd1 = Open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    8		Close(fd1);
    9		fd2 = Open("baz.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    10		printf("fd2 = %d\n", fd2);
    11		exit(0);
    12	}
    ```

A: 
Each process created in a Unix-like system has three default open file descriptors: standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr). These file descriptors are usually assigned to the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively. The `Open` function returns the lowest unopened file descriptor, starting from the value of 3.

In the given program, the first call to `Open` opens the file "foo.txt" for reading and returns the file descriptor 3. The next line calls the `Close` function which closes the file descriptor 3.

Finally, the second call to `Open` opens the file "baz.txt" for reading and returns the file descriptor 3 because it is the lowest unopened file descriptor. The output of the program is `fd2 = 3`.
