## What are the different types of Linux files?

Each Linux file has a type that indicates its role in the system:

1.  Regular file: contains arbitrary data. Application programs often distinguish between text files and binary files. To the kernel, there is no difference between text and binary files.
2.  Directory: consists of an array of links, where each link maps a filename to a file, which may be another directory.
3.  Socket: a file that is used to communicate with another process across a network.
4.  Other file types: named pipes, symbolic links, and character and block devices, which are beyond our scope.

## What are the special entries in a directory?

Each directory contains at least two entries:

1.  . (dot): a link to the directory itself.
2.  .. (dot-dot): a link to the parent directory in the directory hierarchy.

## How does the Linux kernel organize files?

The Linux kernel organizes all files in a single directory hierarchy anchored by the root directory named `/` (slash). Each file in the system is a direct or indirect descendant of the root directory.

## What is the current working directory in the context of a process?

As part of its context, each process has a current working directory that identifies its current location in the directory hierarchy. You can change the shell's current working directory with the `cd` command.

## What are pathnames and their two forms in Linux?

Locations in the directory hierarchy are specified by pathnames. A pathname is a string consisting of an optional slash followed by a sequence of filenames separated by slashes. Pathnames have two forms:

1.  Absolute pathname: starts with a slash and denotes a path from the root node. For example, the absolute pathname for `hello.c` might be `/home/droh/hello.c`.
2.  Relative pathname: starts with a filename and denotes a path from the current working directory. For example, if `/home/droh` is the current working directory, then the relative pathname for `hello.c` is `./hello.c`.
