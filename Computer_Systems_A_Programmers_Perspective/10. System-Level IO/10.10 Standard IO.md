## What is the standard I/O library in C language?

The standard I/O library in C language provides a set of higher-level input and output functions, offering a higher-level alternative to Unix I/O. The library (libc) includes functions for opening and closing files (fopen and fclose), reading and writing bytes (fread and fwrite), reading and writing strings (fgets and fputs), and sophisticated formatted I/O (scanf and printf).

## How does the standard I/O library model an open file?

The standard I/O library models an open file as a stream. To the programmer, a stream is a pointer to a structure of type FILE. Every ANSI C program begins with three open streams: stdin, stdout, and stderr, corresponding to standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
extern FILE *stdin;   /* Standard input (descriptor 0) */
extern FILE *stdout;  /* Standard output (descriptor 1) */
extern FILE *stderr;  /* Standard error (descriptor 2) */
```
## What is the purpose of a stream buffer in the standard I/O library?

A stream of type FILE is an abstraction for a file descriptor and a stream buffer. The purpose of the stream buffer is to minimize the number of expensive Linux I/O system calls, similar to the Rio read buffer.

For example, consider a program that makes repeated calls to the standard I/O `getc` function, where each invocation returns the next character from a file. When `getc` is called the first time, the library fills the stream buffer with a single call to the `read` function and then returns the first byte in the buffer to the application. As long as there are unread bytes in the buffer, subsequent calls to `getc` can be served directly from the stream buffer.
