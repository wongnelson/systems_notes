1. **Basic Hardware Interfacing and QEMU Exit Codes:** Before moving into other components, you must establish basic communication with the underlying hardware, particularly the ability to indicate the state of your OS. This includes defining the `QemuExitCode` and `exit_qemu` function. The `QemuExitCode` enumeration represents the two primary exit states of an OS: `Success` or `Failed`. The `exit_qemu` function writes the exit code to the special port `0xf4`, which QEMU listens to and exits upon receiving a magic value.
    
2. **Serial Communication:** Next, it's crucial to have a method to communicate with external devices or interfaces for debugging purposes. The `SERIAL1` static reference creates and initializes a `SerialPort` at the I/O port `0x3F8`. It's locked behind a Mutex to ensure thread-safe operations. This step is necessary before creating the print macros and panic handling which rely on serial communication.
    
3. **Output Macros:** These are needed to print information to the host through the serial interface for debugging and error reporting. `serial_print` and `serial_println` are macros that use the `_print` function to send formatted strings to the host system over serial communication. This step must come before panic handling and testing, which rely on these macros to output information.
    
4. **Panic Handling:** This step is for handling unexpected or critical errors within the OS. Panic handling is dependent on the previous steps as it uses `QemuExitCode` (from step 1) to exit QEMU with a certain code, and the output macros (from step 3) to print information about the panic.
    
5. **Test Framework:** Finally, a test framework is important for validating the functionality of the OS. `Testable` trait and `test_runner` function form the core of this framework, with the former providing a method to run the test and the latter serving as the runner for all tests. This framework depends on the panic handling mechanism (for handling test failures) and the output macros (for printing test results).
