    loop {}
}
```
Q: explain the top code?
Line 6: 
we need it because without it, the compiler would do name mangling, as it expects "main" to be the entry point of the program with the C runtime call. Since we're not using the C runtime, the compiler won't recognize the entry point and "name mangle" the function into something like `_ZN3blog_os4_start7hb173fedf945531caE`  

Line 8:
- pub extern "C" tells the compiler to use the C calling convention. 
- _\_start is the entry point for most systems
- The `!` return type means that the function is diverging, i.e. not allowed to ever return. This is required because the entry point is not called by any function, but invoked directly by the operating system or bootloader. So instead of returning, the entry point should e.g. invoke the [`exit` system call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_(system_call)) of the operating system.


## Q: What are the requirements for writing an operating system kernel in Rust?

A: To write an operating system kernel in Rust, the code should not depend on any operating system features such as threads, files, heap memory, the network, random numbers, standard output, or any other features that require OS abstractions or specific hardware. This means that most of the Rust standard library cannot be used. However, Rust features such as iterators, closures, pattern matching, option and result, string formatting, and the ownership system can be used to write the kernel in a high-level and expressive way without worrying about undefined behavior or memory safety.

## Q: What is a freestanding Rust binary?

A: A freestanding Rust binary is an executable that can be run without an underlying operating system. This type of executable is required to create an operating system kernel in Rust.

## Q: What is the difference between a library and an executable binary in Rust?

A: In Rust, a library is a collection of Rust code that can be used by other Rust programs. An executable binary, on the other hand, is a standalone program that can be run directly. When creating a new Rust project, the user can specify whether they want to create a library or an executable binary using the `--bin` or `--lib` flag respectively, while running the `cargo new` command.

## Q: Why is the standard library disabled in a freestanding Rust binary?

A: The standard library depends on the operating system for features such as threads, files, or networking, and it also depends on the C standard library libc, which closely interacts with OS services. Since the goal is to write an operating system, the standard library and its dependencies cannot be used and must be disabled through the `#![no_std]` attribute.

## Q: What happens when the standard library is disabled in Rust?

A: When the standard library is disabled, Rust code that depends on it, such as the `println!` macro, will not work and result in a compile error. This makes sense since the `println!` macro writes to standard output, which is a special file descriptor provided by the operating system.

## Q: What is the purpose of the `panic_handler` attribute in Rust?

A: The `panic_handler` attribute in Rust defines the function that the compiler should invoke when a panic occurs. A panic in Rust is an unrecoverable error that typically occurs when a program encounters an unexpected situation that it cannot handle. The panic handler function defined with the `#[panic_handler]` attribute provides a way to handle panics in a custom way. Panics in Rust are explicit.

Panics are intended to indicate a programming error, such as a null pointer dereference, an out-of-bounds array index, or an uninitialized variable.

When a panic occurs, the program will stop executing and print a panic message to the console. This message usually includes the file and line number where the panic occurred, as well as any additional information provided by the panic trigger, such as a custom panic message.

Panics are intended to be used as a last resort, when other error handling mechanisms, such as the `Result` type, are not sufficient to handle an error. Panics are intended to provide a clear indication of a programming error, and they are intended to be used to help developers quickly identify and fix bugs in their code.

#### C equivalent 
there is an equivalent to a panic in C, although it is not built into the language itself. In C, a panic-like behavior can be achieved by using the `assert` macro, which is defined in the `assert.h` header.

The `assert` macro takes an expression as an argument and evaluates it. If the expression is false, `assert` will trigger an error by calling the `abort` function, which terminates the program immediately. Like a panic, the `assert` macro is intended to indicate a programming error and to provide a clear indication of the source of the error.

Here's an example of using the `assert` macro in C:
```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    assert(x > 0);
    printf("x is positive\n");
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `assert` macro will evaluate the expression `x > 0`, which is true. As a result, the program will continue executing and will print the message "x is positive" to the console.

However, if the value of `x` were changed to a negative number, the expression `x > 0` would evaluate to false, and the `assert` macro would trigger an error by calling the `abort` function, which would terminate the program immediately.

## Q: What is the purpose of the `eh_personality` language item in Rust?

A: The `eh_personality` language item in Rust marks a function that is used for implementing stack unwinding. Stack unwinding is a process that runs the destructors of all live stack variables in case of a panic, freeing all used memory and allowing the parent thread to catch the panic and continue execution. The `eh_personality` language item is required for this process, but it requires some OS-specific libraries, so it may not be appropriate for all use cases, such as in the case of an operating system kernel.

## Q: What is the difference between the standard library's panic handler and a custom panic handler in Rust?

A: The standard library provides its own panic handler function, but in a no_std environment, the panic handler must be defined by the user. The custom panic handler function defined with the `#[panic_handler]` attribute allows the user to handle panics in a way that is appropriate for their specific use case. In the case of an operating system kernel, for example, the custom panic handler may simply loop indefinitely instead of unwinding the stack.
