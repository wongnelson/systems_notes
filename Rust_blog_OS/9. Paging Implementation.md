## What are the Challenges with Accessing Page Tables from Our Kernel?

Accessing page tables from our kernel may seem straightforward, but it's not. The problem lies in the fact that our kernel operates on top of virtual addresses, not physical ones. 

In a 4-level page table hierarchy, each page table entry stores the physical address of the next table. This design is necessary to avoid a translation for these addresses, which could negatively impact performance and potentially create endless translation loops.

However, this presents a challenge for us. Let's say we want to access address 4 KiB. When we attempt this, we are accessing the virtual address 4 KiB, not the physical address 4 KiB where the level 4 page table is stored. If we wish to access the physical address 4 KiB, we can only do so through some virtual address that maps to it.

In other words, to access page table frames, we need to map some virtual pages to them. There are different ways to achieve this, allowing us to access arbitrary page table frames.

## What is Identity Mapping of Page Tables?

One solution to accessing physical page table frames from our kernel is to identity map all page tables. This means that the virtual addresses of the page tables correspond directly to their physical addresses.

Consider this illustration:
![[Pasted image 20230705112319.png]]


In this example, we have various identity-mapped page table frames. The physical addresses of the page tables also serve as valid virtual addresses. This allows us to easily access the page tables of all levels starting from the CR3 register.

However, this approach is not without its drawbacks. Identity mapping of all page tables clutters the virtual address space, making it more challenging to find continuous memory regions of larger sizes. 

For instance, let's imagine that we want to create a virtual memory region of size 1000 KiB, perhaps for memory-mapping a file. We can't start the region at 28 KiB because it would collide with the already mapped page at 1004 KiB. Therefore, we must search further until we find a large enough unmapped area, for example, at 1008 KiB. This issue is akin to the fragmentation problem experienced with segmentation.

Creating new page tables also becomes more complicated because we need to find physical frames whose corresponding pages aren't already in use. If we had reserved the virtual 1000 KiB memory region starting at 1008 KiB for our memory-mapped file, we wouldn't be able to use any frame with a physical address between 1000 KiB and 2008 KiB because we can't identity map it.

## What is the Mapping of Page Tables at a Fixed Offset?

To circumvent the problem of cluttering the virtual address space, we can designate a separate memory region for page table mappings. Instead of identity mapping page table frames, we map them at a fixed offset in the virtual address space. For example, the offset could be 10 TiB.

Consider the following illustration:
![[Pasted image 20230705112344.png]]

By exclusively using the virtual memory in the range 10 TiB..(10 TiB + physical memory size) for page table mappings, we bypass the collision problems of identity mapping. Reserving such a substantial portion of the virtual address space is feasible only if the virtual address space is significantly larger than the physical memory size. This isn't a problem on x86_64 systems, as the 48-bit address space is 256 TiB large.

While this method mitigates the issues faced with identity mapping, it still has some downsides. We must create a new mapping every time we create a new page table. Furthermore, this approach doesn't allow accessing page tables of other address spaces, which would be beneficial when creating a new process.

## What is the Approach of Mapping the Complete Physical Memory for Page Tables?

One way to solve the issue of mapping page tables is by mapping the entire physical memory instead of just the page table frames.

![[Pasted image 20230705114910.png]]

In this approach, our kernel can access any physical memory, including page table frames of other address spaces. The reserved virtual memory range remains the same size, with the only difference being that it no longer contains unmapped pages.

However, this method has a downside. Additional page tables are needed to store the mapping of the physical memory. These tables must be stored somewhere, consuming a portion of the physical memory. This can pose a problem on devices with limited memory.

On x86_64 systems, we can mitigate this issue by using huge pages of 2 MiB size for mapping instead of the default 4 KiB pages. Mapping 32 GiB of physical memory then only requires 132 KiB for page tables, as we only need one level 3 table and 32 level 2 tables. Huge pages also boost cache efficiency, as they use fewer entries in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).

This technique of mapping the entire physical memory to a portion of the virtual memory space can solve certain problems and provide advantages:

1. **Solves Collision Problem**: In the previous approach where only page tables were mapped, there was a possibility of a collision between the physical address and virtual address spaces. This could occur if a physical address coincided with a virtual address that was already mapped to a different physical address. By mapping the entire physical memory to a distinct range of the virtual address space, we ensure that there is a one-to-one correspondence between physical addresses and their corresponding virtual addresses in that range, thereby avoiding any collisions.

2. **Easier Access to Physical Memory**: By having a direct mapping from the virtual address space to the physical memory, any location in physical memory can be accessed directly without the need to perform a translation. This can simplify some operations in the kernel.

3. **Simplified Handling of Page Tables**: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Because</mark> all page tables are included in this mapping of physical memory, there is no need to handle the mapping of individual page tables separately.

4. **Performance Improvement with Huge Pages**: By using huge pages, we need fewer entries in our page tables (since each entry covers more memory). This means fewer page tables, saving physical memory. Using fewer entries in page tables can also improve efficiency by reducing the amount of entries needed in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), a cache used to speed up virtual-to-physical address translations.

However, it's important to note that this technique comes with trade-offs. Mapping the entire physical memory consumes more virtual address space, which may not be desirable on systems with a smaller addressable memory. And although using huge pages can alleviate the problem of using additional memory for page tables, huge pages are not always suitable for every task because they are less granular than regular-sized pages. 

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pink</mark>
We need access to the page tables for manipulating virtual to physical address mappings. This could be necessary for various operations like allocating new memory or modifying existing memory mappings.

Page tables reside in physical memory, so in order to manipulate them, we need a way to access them from our virtual address space. Thus, we need to map them into our virtual address space.

If we only map individual page tables into our virtual address space as we need them, we have to manage these mappings individually. Each time we need to modify a different page table, we would need to set up a new mapping for it, and possibly remove a mapping for a different page table if we're limited in how many we can have at once. This can become complex to handle.

However, if we map the entire physical memory into our virtual address space, this includes the physical memory locations where all page tables are stored. This means we can access any page table directly through this mapping. Therefore, we no longer have to handle the mapping of individual page tables separately, because they are all included in the large mapping of all physical memory. This simplifies the management of page tables, as we can directly access any page table without needing to set up a new mapping each time.

Let's say you have 16GB of physical memory and a virtual memory space of 48 bits (256 TiB). Let's also assume that our operating system uses the page table to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.

### Individual Mapping:

Suppose you have two processes, P1 and P2, each of which has its own page table, PT1 and PT2 respectively. These page tables exist in physical memory.

If P1 needs to modify its own page table, PT1, the operating system would need to create a mapping in P1's virtual address space that maps to the physical location of PT1.

Similarly, if P2 needs to modify its page table, the operating system would need to create a mapping in P2's virtual address space that maps to the physical location of PT2.

Every time a new process needs to access its page table, the OS needs to create a new mapping for that particular page table. This means a lot of management overhead for the OS to keep track of these individual mappings.

### Full Physical Memory Mapping:

Instead of individually mapping each page table as needed, the OS can create a "master" mapping at a fixed offset that maps the entire 16GB of physical memory into the virtual address space. This would be a large contiguous region in the virtual memory space.

Now, every location in physical memory, including PT1, PT2, and any other page table, has a corresponding virtual address in this mapped region.

So, if P1 needs to modify its page table, PT1, the OS doesn't need to set up a new mapping. It can simply calculate the virtual address in the "master" mapping region that corresponds to PT1 and make the modifications.

Similarly, if P2 needs to modify its page table, the OS doesn't need to create a new mapping either. It can calculate the virtual address that corresponds to PT2 in the "master" mapping region and make the modifications.

In this way, the OS can simplify its management of page table mappings by creating a single "master" mapping of the entire physical memory. This eliminates the need to handle the mapping of individual page tables separately, because they are all included in the large mapping of all physical memory.

### What are the Downsides of Mapping the Complete Physical Memory?

Although mapping the complete physical memory allows the kernel to access arbitrary physical memory, this approach comes with a significant downside. It requires additional page tables to store the mapping of the physical memory. These page tables consume some portion of the physical memory, which could be a significant drawback on devices with limited memory resources.

While the size of the reserved virtual memory remains the same, it no longer contains any unmapped pages. All physical memory, including page table frames from other address spaces, is accessible to our kernel. However, it's important to note that these additional page tables needed for storing the physical memory mapping must be stored somewhere, using a part of the physical memory.

## What is the Temporary Mapping Approach for Page Tables?

For devices with very limited physical memory, we could adopt a strategy of mapping the page table frames temporarily when we need to access them. To create these temporary mappings, we only need a single identity-mapped level 1 table.

Consider the following illustration:
![[Pasted image 20230705200355.png]]

In this example, the level 1 table controls the first 2 MiB of the virtual address space. This is achievable by starting at the CR3 register and following the 0th entry in the level 4, level 3, and level 2 page tables. The entry with index 8 maps the virtual page at address 32 KiB to the physical frame at address 32 KiB, effectively identity mapping the level 1 table itself.

By writing to the identity-mapped level 1 table, our kernel can create up to 511 temporary mappings (512 minus the entry needed for the identity mapping). For instance, in the above scenario, the kernel has created two temporary mappings:

- By mapping the 0th entry of the level 1 table to the frame with address 24 KiB, it has temporarily mapped the virtual page at 0 KiB to the physical frame of the level 2 page table.
- By mapping the 9th entry of the level 1 table to the frame with address 4 KiB, it has temporarily mapped the virtual page at 36 KiB to the physical frame of the level 4 page table.

The kernel can now access the level 2 page table by writing to page 0 KiB and the level 4 page table by writing to page 36 KiB.

To access any page table frame with temporary mappings, we can follow these steps:

1. Search for a free entry in the identity-mapped level 1 table.
2. Map that entry to the physical frame of the page table that we want to access.
3. Access the target frame through the virtual page that maps to the entry.
4. Set the entry back to unused, thereby removing the temporary mapping.

This approach requires only 4 KiB of physical memory as it reuses the same 512 virtual pages for creating the mappings. The downside is its complexity, especially considering that a new mapping might require modifications to multiple table levels, resulting in repeated application of the process.

## What is the Concept of Recursive Page Tables?

Recursive page tables is a technique that doesn't require additional page tables for mapping. The basic idea behind this is to map an entry from the level 4 page table to the level 4 table itself. In effect, we reserve a portion of the virtual address space and map all current and future page table frames to this space.

Let's understand this concept through an example:

An example of a 4-level page hierarchy, each page table shown in physical memory. Entry 511 of the level 4 page is mapped to frame 4KiB, the frame of the level 4 table itself.

In this example, the only difference from a typical table is an additional entry at index 511 in the level 4 table. This entry is mapped to the physical frame 4 KiB, which is the frame of the level 4 table itself. 

When the CPU follows this entry during a translation, it doesn't reach a level 3 table but ends up at the same level 4 table again. This is akin to a recursive function that calls itself, hence the term "recursive page table". The key point here is that the CPU assumes that every entry in the level 4 table points to a level 3 table, so it treats the level 4 table as if it were a level 3 table. This is possible because the tables of all levels have the same layout on x86_64.

## How Does the Recursive Page Table Work?

By following the recursive entry one or more times before starting the actual translation, we can effectively reduce the number of levels that the CPU traverses. 

For instance, if we follow the recursive entry once and then proceed to the level 3 table, the CPU thinks that the level 3 table is a level 2 table. Following this logic, the CPU treats the level 2 table as a level 1 table, and the level 1 table as the mapped frame. As a result, we can read and write to the level 1 page table because the CPU believes it is the mapped frame.

You can visualize these translation steps in the following illustration:

The original 4-level page hierarchy with 5 arrows:
- "Step 0" from CR4 to the level 4 table,
- "Step 1" from the level 4 table to the level 4 table,
- "Step 2" from the level 4 table to the level 3 table,
- "Step 3" from the level 3 table to the level 2 table,
- "Step 4" from the level 2 table to the level 1 table.

We can also follow the recursive entry twice before starting the translation to reduce the number of traversed levels to two:

The same 4-level page hierarchy with the following 4 arrows:
- "Step 0" from CR4 to the level 4 table,
- "Steps 1&2" from the level 4 table to the level 4 table,
- "Step 3" from the level 4 table to the level 3 table,
- "Step 4" from the level 3 table to the level 2 table.

In this case, first, the CPU follows the recursive entry on the level 4 table and thinks it has reached a level 3 table. It then follows the recursive entry again, believing it has reached a level 2 table. In reality, it is still on the level 4 table. When the CPU follows a different entry next, it lands on a level 3 table but believes it's on a level 1 table. So even though the next entry points to a level 2 table, the CPU thinks it's pointing to the mapped frame,

## How to Access Different Levels of Page Tables Using the Recursive Entry?

Accessing the tables of levels 3 and 4 happens in a similar way. To reach the level 3 table, we follow the recursive entry three times, causing the CPU to think it has already reached a level 1 table. Then, we follow another entry and land on a level 3 table, which the CPU treats as a mapped frame.

To access the level 4 table itself, we just follow the recursive entry four times until the CPU treats the level 4 table itself as the mapped frame. Here is a visual representation of this process:

The same 4-level page hierarchy with the following 3 arrows:
- "Step 0" from CR4 to level 4 table,
- "Steps 1,2,3" from level 4 table to level 4 table,
- "Step 4" from level 4 table to level 3 table.

And in blue, the alternative "Steps 1,2,3,4" arrow from level 4 table to level 4 table.

Although this concept might take some time to fully grasp, it works quite well in practice. 

## How to Construct Virtual Addresses for Following the Recursive Entry?

Understanding how to construct virtual addresses for following the recursive entry is important. However, constructing addresses for recursive paging can get a bit complex, so I will explain it in another section.

Note: If you are not planning to implement recursive paging, you don't need to understand this aspect in detail. If you're interested, continue reading the next section.

## How is Recursive Paging Implemented in Code?

If you were to implement recursive paging in a programming language such as Rust, you would create a structure for the level 4 page table, with one of its entries pointing to the table itself. Here's a simplified example:

```rust
struct PageTable {
    entries: [Entry; 512],
}

impl PageTable {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let mut table = Self {
            entries: [Entry::new(); 512],
        };
        table.entries[511] = Entry::recursive();  // Map to itself
        table
    }
}
```

In the `new` function, we're creating a new `PageTable` where the 512th entry maps recursively to the page table itself. The `Entry::recursive()` function would set up the specifics of the recursive mapping. This recursive entry allows us to create a loop in the page translation process, effectively letting us access any level of the page table hierarchy.
