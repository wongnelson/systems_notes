## VGA Text Mode

VGA (Video Graphics Array) text mode is a simple method of printing text on the screen. It's especially useful in scenarios where the graphical interface isn't yet initialized, like in an early-stage operating system kernel. 

### What is the VGA Text Buffer?

The VGA text buffer is a specific region of memory, typically organized as a two-dimensional array with 25 rows and 80 columns, which is directly rendered on the screen. Each entry in this array describes a single character on the screen using the following format:

Bits | Value
---|---
0-7 | ASCII code point
8-11 | Foreground color
12-14 | Background color
15 | Blink

The first byte represents the character to be printed, encoded in ASCII. To be precise, it isn't exactly ASCII but a character set named code page 437, which has additional characters and slight modifications compared to ASCII. 

The second byte defines the presentation of the character. The first four bits define the foreground color, the next three bits define the background color, and the last bit defines whether the character should blink or not.

This VGA text buffer is accessible via memory-mapped I/O at the address `0xb8000`. This means that reads and writes to that address don't access the RAM but directly access the text buffer on the VGA hardware. 

### How Can We Represent the Colors in VGA Text Mode?

We can represent the colors using a Rust enum like this:
[[Attributes#[allow(dead_code)]]]
```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum Color {
    Black = 0,
    Blue = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Cyan = 3,
    Red = 4,
    Magenta = 5,
    Brown = 6,
    LightGray = 7,
    DarkGray = 8,
    LightBlue = 9,
    LightGreen = 10,
    LightCyan = 11,
    LightRed = 12,
    Pink = 13,
    Yellow = 14,
    White = 15,
}
```

Here, we're using a C-like enum to explicitly specify the number for each color. Due to the `repr(u8)` attribute, each enum variant is stored as a `u8`. 

To represent a full color code that specifies both foreground and background color, we can create a newtype on top of `u8`:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[repr(transparent)]
struct ColorCode(u8);

impl ColorCode {
    fn new(foreground: Color, background: Color) -> ColorCode {
        ColorCode((background as u8) << 4 | (foreground as u8))
    }
}
```

This `ColorCode` struct represents the full color byte, which includes both the foreground and background color.

The `shift left by 4` operation is used in the `ColorCode::new` function to combine the foreground and background colors into a single byte value.

Let's take an example where we have a foreground color of `2` (binary `0010`) and a background color of `6` (binary `0110`). The shift left by 4 operation and the bitwise OR will combine these two colors into a single byte value representing the color code.

Foreground color: 0010
Background color (shifted): 01100000
Combined color: 01100010

#### Why does the ColorCode struct have a param?
In the statement `struct ColorCode(u8);`, the parameter `u8` is used to define the type of the field `ColorCode` in the struct. It specifies that the `ColorCode` struct has a single field of type `u8`.

In this case, `ColorCode(u8)` is a tuple struct, which is a lightweight way to define a struct with a single field. The parameter `u8` represents the type of the field in the tuple struct.

Here's an example usage of the `ColorCode` struct:

```rust
struct ColorCode(u8);

fn main() {
    let color_code = ColorCode(0b1100);  // Create a ColorCode instance with the value 0b1100 (binary representation)
    println!("Color code: {}", color_code.0);  // Access the value of the ColorCode field using dot notation
}
```

In the example, `ColorCode(0b1100)` creates an instance of the `ColorCode` struct with the value `0b1100` (binary representation). The field of the struct can be accessed using dot notation, like `color_code.0`, to retrieve the value.

The struct definition parameter allows you to specify the type and number of fields in the struct, which determines the structure and behavior of the struct instances.

#### Why is repr(u8) needed for Color enum?
The `#[repr(u8)]` attribute is used to specify the representation of the `Color` enum in memory. In this case, `repr(u8)` indicates that each variant of the enum will be represented using a single byte.

If the `repr` attribute is omitted, Rust will use the default representation, which is `repr(isize)`. This means that each variant of the enum would be represented using the platform's native signed integer type (`isize`), which typically has a size of either 32 or 64 bits depending on the architecture.

In the context of the `Color` enum, omitting the `repr(u8)` attribute would result in larger memory consumption for each variant. Each variant would occupy the size of the platform's native integer type, which is typically larger than a single byte. This would be unnecessary and inefficient since the enum variants only need to represent values from 0 to 15.

Here's a practical example to illustrate the memory usage difference:

```rust
enum Color {
    Black = 0,
    Blue = 1,
    Green = 2,
    // ... other variants omitted for brevity
    White = 15,
}

fn main() {
    println!("Size of Color enum: {} bytes", std::mem::size_of::<Color>());
}
```

With the `repr(u8)` attribute, the output will be `1 byte`. This indicates that each variant of the `Color` enum is represented using a single byte.

If the `repr(u8)` attribute is omitted, the output will be larger than `1 byte`, depending on the platform's native integer size. For example, on a 64-bit platform, the output might be `8 bytes`, indicating that each variant occupies 8 bytes of memory.

By explicitly specifying `repr(u8)`, you ensure that the enum uses the most compact representation possible, which is appropriate for the range of values it represents.

### How to Create a Rust Module to Handle Printing to the VGA Buffer?

To create a Rust module to handle printing, you could start by defining a module in your `src/main.rs` file like this:

```rust
// in src/main.rs
mod vga_buffer;
```

For the content of this module, you could create a new `src/vga_buffer.rs` file. All the code related to the VGA buffer should go into this new module.

Using this approach, you encapsulate all the VGA-related operations into one module, making the code more organized and modular.

## Text Buffer and Writer in VGA Text Mode

In VGA text mode, characters are displayed on the screen through an intermediate construct known as a text buffer. This buffer can be understood as a structure that represents a screen character and the text buffer itself.

### What are the ScreenChar and Buffer Structures in VGA Text Mode?

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[repr(C)]
struct ScreenChar {
    ascii_character: u8,
    color_code: ColorCode,
}

const BUFFER_HEIGHT: usize = 25;
const BUFFER_WIDTH: usize = 80;

#[repr(transparent)]
struct Buffer {
    chars: [[ScreenChar; BUFFER_WIDTH]; BUFFER_HEIGHT],
}
```

The `ScreenChar` structure represents a single character on the screen. It includes an ASCII character and its corresponding color code. 

The `Buffer` structure represents the entire text buffer, which is an array of `ScreenChar` structures. It has dimensions defined by `BUFFER_HEIGHT` and `BUFFER_WIDTH`, typically set to 25 and 80 respectively, representing the rows and columns of the screen. 

#### Why is it named Buffer?
Naming the struct `Buffer` is appropriate in this context because it represents the VGA text buffer. The name "Buffer" is commonly used to describe a data structure that holds a collection of elements in memory.

In this case, the `Buffer` struct holds a 2-dimensional array of `ScreenChar` elements, which represents the characters and their associated color codes in the VGA text buffer. The name "Buffer" accurately reflects the purpose and content of the struct, making it clear that it serves as a storage container for the text buffer data.

#### Why is repr(transparent) needed here?
The `#[repr(transparent)]` attribute is used in the context of the `Buffer` struct to indicate that it has the same memory layout and ABI (Application Binary Interface) as its single field, which is the `chars` array.

In this case, `Buffer` contains only one field, `chars`, which is a 2-dimensional array of `ScreenChar` elements. By using `#[repr(transparent)]`, you're explicitly stating that there is no additional memory or padding introduced by the `Buffer` struct itself. The memory layout of `Buffer` is precisely the same as that of its field, `chars`.

This attribute is often used when you want to ensure that a wrapper struct or type has the same memory representation as the underlying field, without any additional overhead. It allows you to treat the wrapper type as if it were the field type itself, providing a more convenient and seamless interface.

In the given code snippet, `#[repr(transparent)]` is used to enforce that `Buffer` does not introduce any additional memory layout or alignment requirements beyond the `chars` array. It's done to maintain compatibility with the underlying VGA text buffer structure and to allow direct access to the buffer's elements without any extra layers introduced by the `Buffer` struct.

Overall, `#[repr(transparent)]` is used to guarantee that the memory layout and behavior of the wrapper type (`Buffer`) mimic those of its field (`chars`), enabling a more efficient and direct interaction with the VGA text buffer.

#### Why usize for buffer dimensions?
By using `usize` for the buffer dimensions, we ensure that the array indices, size calculations, and assignments operate correctly and consistently on the target platform, regardless of whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit system. It provides the appropriate integer type that matches the platform's memory addressing capabilities.

```c
const BUFFER_HEIGHT: usize = 25;
const BUFFER_WIDTH: usize = 80;

struct Buffer {
    chars: [[u8; BUFFER_WIDTH]; BUFFER_HEIGHT],
}

fn main() {
    let buffer = Buffer {
        chars: [[0; BUFFER_WIDTH]; BUFFER_HEIGHT],
    };

    // Accessing the buffer dimensions
    let height = BUFFER_HEIGHT;
    let width = BUFFER_WIDTH;

    println!("Buffer height: {}", height);
    println!("Buffer width: {}", width);
}
```

### How is the Writer Structure Defined in VGA Text Mode?

The `Writer` structure is responsible for writing characters to the screen. It always writes to the last line and shifts lines up when a line is full or encounters a newline character (`\n`).

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

pub struct Writer {
    column_position: usize,
    color_code: ColorCode,
    buffer: &'static mut Buffer,
}
```

The `column_position`, `color_code`, and `buffer` fields in the `Writer` struct have specific attributes for the following reasons:

1. `column_position: usize`: This field represents the current column position in the VGA text buffer. It tracks the column index where the next character will be written. Using the `usize` type is appropriate here because it allows for indexing and counting positions within the buffer. The `usize` type is commonly used for representing sizes and indices of collections.

2. `color_code: ColorCode`: This field holds the current color code for text in the VGA text buffer. It determines the foreground and background colors of the characters. Using the `ColorCode` type is appropriate because it encapsulates the necessary information for defining the color of the text. The `ColorCode` type is defined earlier in the code and provides a convenient way to specify and manipulate color codes.

3. `buffer: &'static mut Buffer`: This field holds a mutable reference to the VGA text buffer. It allows the `Writer` struct to directly access and modify the buffer's content. The use of `&'static mut Buffer` indicates that the reference has a `'static` lifetime, meaning it can live for the entire duration of the program. This is appropriate because the VGA text buffer is expected to exist and be accessible throughout the execution of the OS.

By using these specific attributes, the `Writer` struct is able to keep track of the current column position, manage the color codes for text, and have direct access to the VGA text buffer, enabling it to write characters and manipulate the buffer efficiently.

#### Why no row pos?
The `Writer` struct does not have a `row_position` attribute because the row position is implicitly determined based on the current state of the VGA text buffer. 

In the VGA text buffer, new lines are created by shifting all lines one line up and clearing the last row. The `new_line` method in the `Writer` struct is responsible for this behavior. It updates the buffer by moving all characters up one row and clears the last row. After calling `new_line`, the `column_position` is reset to 0, indicating that the next character will be written at the beginning of the new line.

Since the row position is determined by the current state of the buffer and the `new_line` method handles the shifting and clearing of rows, there is no need for an explicit `row_position` attribute in the `Writer` struct. The `column_position` and the height of the buffer (`BUFFER_HEIGHT`) are sufficient to calculate the row position when writing characters.

By tracking the `column_position` and using the height of the buffer, the `Writer` struct is able to navigate and update the buffer effectively without needing a separate `row_position` attribute.

### How Does the Writer Handle Printing in VGA Text Mode?

The `Writer` modifies the buffer's characters using its methods. Here's an example of how to write a single ASCII byte:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

impl Writer {
    pub fn write_byte(&mut self, byte: u8) {
        match byte {
            b'\n' => self.new_line(),
            byte => {
                if self.column_position >= BUFFER_WIDTH {
                    self.new_line();
                }

                let row = BUFFER_HEIGHT - 1;
                let col = self.column_position;

                let color_code = self.color_code;
                self.buffer.chars[row][col] = ScreenChar {
                    ascii_character: byte,
                    color_code,
                };
                self.column_position += 1;
            }
        }
    }

    fn new_line(&mut self) {/* TODO */}
}
```

In the `write_byte` method, if the byte is a newline (`\n`), the writer calls a `new_line` method (to be implemented later). Other bytes get printed to the screen. 

For printing strings, the `Writer` can convert them into bytes and print them one by one:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

impl Writer {
    pub fn write_string(&mut self, s: &str) {
        for byte in s.bytes() {
            match byte {
                // printable ASCII byte or newline
                0x20..=0x7e | b'\n' => self.write_byte(byte),
                // not part of printable ASCII range
                _ => self.write_byte(0xfe),
            }

        }
    }
}
```

In this case, it differentiates printable ASCII bytes and unprintable bytes. For unprintable bytes, it prints a specific character that has the hex code `0xfe` on the VGA hardware.

#### Why BUFFER_HEIGHT - 1?
The line `let row = BUFFER_HEIGHT - 1;` in the `write_byte` method of the `Writer` struct is used to determine the row index in the VGA text buffer where the ASCII byte will be written.

The VGA text buffer is a two-dimensional array of characters that represents the screen. The rows in the buffer are numbered from 0 to `BUFFER_HEIGHT - 1`, and the columns are numbered from 0 to `BUFFER_WIDTH - 1`.

In this case, `BUFFER_HEIGHT - 1` is used to obtain the index of the last row in the buffer. Since the VGA text buffer is a fixed-size buffer with a specific height (`BUFFER_HEIGHT`), the last row index can be calculated by subtracting 1 from the buffer height. By using the last row index, the `write_byte` method writes the ASCII byte at the appropriate position in the buffer, taking into account the current column position (`column_position`) of the `Writer`.

The `- 1` adjustment is necessary because array indices in Rust (and many other programming languages) start from 0, so the first row is at index 0, the second row at index 1, and so on. By subtracting 1 from the buffer height, we obtain the index of the last row in the buffer.

## What is Volatile in the Context of the Rust Programming Language?

Volatile is a keyword used in programming languages, such as Rust, to prevent the compiler from optimizing away subsequent reads/writes to the variable, even if they appear unnecessary. This is because these operations might have side effects that are not apparent in the source code, such as hardware I/O or other synchronization with concurrent activities.

In the context of working with the VGA buffer memory in Rust, if we only write to the Buffer and never read from it again, future Rust compilers that optimize more aggressively might deem these write operations unnecessary and remove them. As the compiler isn't aware that we're actually interacting with VGA buffer memory (which would reflect the write operations on the screen), specifying these writes as volatile prevents such erroneous optimization. Without explicit indications, the compiler may assume that the write operations are not necessary since the values are not being used subsequently.

Here's an example that demonstrates how the compiler might optimize away write operations if it determines that the written values are not being used subsequently:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buffer: [u8; 1024] = [0; 1024];

    // Write operation
    buffer[0] = 42;

    // The value written to buffer[0] is not used subsequently
    // No other operations or functions are called that read or modify buffer[0]

    // The compiler might optimize away the write operation
}
```

In this example, we have a mutable buffer of size 1024. We perform a write operation to `buffer[0]`, assigning the value 42 to it. However, since the written value is not used subsequently in any other operations or functions, the compiler might determine that this write operation is unnecessary and remove it during optimization.

By default, the compiler performs various optimizations to improve performance and reduce unnecessary operations. In this case, since the written value is not used, the compiler may optimize it out entirely, considering it redundant.

### How Do You Use Volatile Writes in Rust?

To use volatile writes in Rust, you can use the volatile library. This crate provides a `Volatile` wrapper type with `read` and `write` methods. These methods internally use the `read_volatile` and `write_volatile` functions of the core library, ensuring that the reads/writes are not optimized away.

To add a dependency on the volatile crate in Rust, add it to the dependencies section of the `Cargo.toml` file:

```rust
# in Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
volatile = "0.2.6"
```

Then, you can use the `Volatile` wrapper for your variables. For example:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

use volatile::Volatile;

struct Buffer {
    chars: [[Volatile<ScreenChar>; BUFFER_WIDTH]; BUFFER_HEIGHT],
}
```

In the code above, `ScreenChar` is now wrapped with `Volatile<ScreenChar>`, making all write operations to it volatile. Instead of a normal assignment operation, you would now use the `write` method, as shown below:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

impl Writer {
    pub fn write_byte(&mut self, byte: u8) {
        match byte {
            b'\n' => self.new_line(),
            byte => {
                ...

                self.buffer.chars[row][col].write(ScreenChar {
                    ascii_character: byte,
                    color_code,
                });
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

In this manner, the `write` method ensures that the compiler won't optimize away the write operations to the VGA buffer.

## How Do You Support Formatting Macros in Rust?

To support Rust's formatting macros, you need to implement the `core::fmt::Write` trait. The only required method of this trait is `write_str`. This method should look quite similar to the `write_string` method, just with a `fmt::Result` return type:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

use core::fmt;

impl fmt::Write for Writer {
    fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> fmt::Result {
        self.write_string(s);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Here, `Ok(())` is just an `Ok` Result containing the `()` type.

After implementing the `Write` trait, you can use Rust's built-in `write!/writeln!` formatting macros. The `write!` call returns a `Result` which, if not used, causes a warning. So, you can call the `unwrap` function on it. This isn't a problem because writes to the VGA buffer never fail.

## How Do You Handle Newlines in Rust?

Currently, newlines and characters that don't fit into the line are ignored. Instead, the desired behavior is to move every character one line up (the top line gets deleted), and start

 at the beginning of the last line again. 

To do this, you can implement the `new_line` method of the `Writer`:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

impl Writer {
    fn new_line(&mut self) {
        for row in 1..BUFFER_HEIGHT {
            for col in 0..BUFFER_WIDTH {
                let character = self.buffer.chars[row][col].read();
                self.buffer.chars[row - 1][col].write(character);
            }
        }
        self.clear_row(BUFFER_HEIGHT - 1);
        self.column_position = 0;
    }

    fn clear_row(&mut self, row: usize) {/* TODO */}
}
```

This method iterates over all the screen characters and moves each character one row up. The range notation `..` is exclusive at the upper end and inclusive at the lower end, which is why the range starts at `1` and not `0` (since the first row will be shifted off-screen).

To complete the newline implementation, you need to add the `clear_row` method, which clears a row by overwriting all its characters with a space character:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

impl Writer {
    fn clear_row(&mut self, row: usize) {
        let blank = ScreenChar {
            ascii_character: b' ',
            color_code: self.color_code,
        };
        for col in 0..BUFFER_WIDTH {
            self.buffer.chars[row][col].write(blank);
        }
    }
}
```
This code will effectively clear a row in the VGA buffer by filling it with space characters.

#### Why is .read/.write needed?
[[Volatile]]
A volatile read or write refers to an operation that directly reads from or writes to a memory location, bypassing certain compiler optimizations and ensuring that the operation is performed exactly as intended.

## Why is creating a static Writer causing compilation errors in Rust?

While trying to define a global Writer as a static variable, you may encounter several errors.

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

pub static WRITER: Writer = Writer {
    column_position: 0,
    color_code: ColorCode::new(Color::Yellow, Color::Black),
    buffer: unsafe { &mut *(0xb8000 as *mut Buffer) },
};
```

Rust statics are initialized at compile time as opposed to runtime, evaluated by a part of the compiler called the "const evaluator". However, its functionality is limited. 

1. **Error: Calls in statics are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants**

This is a limitation of Rust's "const evaluator". The `ColorCode::new` function call is not a constant function, which means that it can't be used in a static.

2. **Error: Raw pointers cannot be dereferenced in statics**

This error occurs because Rust's const evaluator is not able to convert raw pointers to references at compile time.

3. **Error: References in statics may only refer to immutable values**

Since statics require immutable values, you can't use a mutable reference (`&mut`) as the value of a static. 

These limitations are related to the fact that statics in Rust are initialized at compile time, so the compiler must be able to evaluate all initialization expressions at compile time.
## What's buffer: unsafe { &mut *(0xb8000 as *mut Buffer) } doing?

The expression `(0xb8000 as *mut Buffer)` performs the cast operation. It converts the integer `0xb8000` to a raw mutable pointer of type `*mut Buffer`. The `*mut Buffer` type signifies a mutable raw pointer that points to an object of type `Buffer`.

The assumption made here is that `0xb8000` is a valid memory address where a `Buffer` object is located. The code treats this address as a pointer to a `Buffer` object, allowing direct access and manipulation of the object's data.

## How can we initialize a static with non-const functions in Rust?

In Rust, initializing statics with non-const functions is a common problem. To solve this, the `lazy_static` crate can be used. The `lazy_static!` macro defines a static that initializes itself when it's first accessed, at runtime. 

Here is an example of how to use the `lazy_static` crate:

```rust
// in Cargo.toml

[dependencies.lazy_static]
version = "1.0"
features = ["spin_no_std"]

// in src/vga_buffer.rs

use lazy_static::lazy_static;

lazy_static! {
    pub static ref WRITER: Writer = Writer {
        column_position: 0,
        color_code: ColorCode::new(Color::Yellow, Color::Black),
        buffer: unsafe { &mut *(0xb8000 as *mut Buffer) },
    };
}
```

The `spin_no_std` feature is needed because we're not linking to the Rust standard library.

## How can we make a static variable mutable in a safe way in Rust?

Even though we now have a global static writer, it is immutable, which makes it impossible to write anything to it. One way to work around this could be using a mutable static (`static mut`), but this introduces a new set of problems, including data races, and is generally considered unsafe and not recommended.

An alternative approach involves using a synchronization primitive to ensure safe concurrent access. The `Mutex` type from the `spin` crate can provide this functionality. Instead of blocking threads when the resource is already locked (like a standard Mutex), a spinlock will keep trying to lock in a tight loop, effectively "spinning" until the resource is free.

```rust
// in Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
spin = "0.5.2"

// in src/vga_buffer.rs

use spin::Mutex;

lazy_static! {
    pub static ref WRITER: Mutex<Writer> = Mutex::new(Writer {
        column_position: 0,
        color_code: ColorCode::new(Color::Yellow, Color::Black),
        buffer: unsafe { &mut *(0xb8000 as *mut Buffer) },
    });
}
```
### Explain pub static ref WRITER: Mutex <\Writer> = Mutex::new(Writer

In the given code, `pub static ref WRITER: Mutex<Writer>` creates a public, static, lazily initialized reference to a `Mutex<Writer>` type. 

Here's an explanation of each component:

- `pub`: It makes the `WRITER` static reference accessible from other modules and code.
- `static`: It indicates that the `WRITER` variable is a static variable, meaning it has a fixed memory location and retains its value throughout the program's execution.
- `ref`: It specifies that `WRITER` is a reference rather than a direct value. This allows accessing the underlying data it references.
- `Mutex<Writer>`: It is the type of the referenced data. In this case, it is a `Mutex` wrapper around the `Writer` struct.
- `= Mutex::new(Writer { ... })`: It initializes the `Mutex<Writer>` with a new instance of the `Writer` struct. This creates a mutable lock guard that provides exclusive access to the `Writer` data.
- `buffer: unsafe { &mut *(0xb8000 as *mut Buffer) }`: It assigns the `buffer` field of the `Writer` struct with a raw mutable pointer to the VGA buffer memory address. The `unsafe` block is used to perform the unsafe operation of creating a mutable reference from the raw pointer.

By using `pub static ref WRITER`, the code provides a globally accessible, lazily initialized, mutable reference to the `Writer` struct wrapped in a `Mutex`. This allows multiple parts of the program to safely access and mutate the shared `Writer` data while ensuring proper synchronization and exclusive access through the mutex lock.

## How can we print to the VGA buffer safely in Rust?

We can print to the VGA buffer safely by encapsulating the unsafe code (the creation of the `Buffer` reference) inside a safe interface. In this case, the `WRITER` static variable is a `Mutex` that encapsulates a `Writer`, and the unsafe operation of creating a `Buffer` reference is performed when the `Writer` is initialized.

Here's how to do it:

```rust
// in src/main.rs
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    use core::fmt::Write;
    vga_buffer::WRITER.lock().write_str("Hello again").unwrap();
    write!(vga_buffer::WRITER.lock(), ", some numbers: {} {}", 42, 1.337).unwrap();

    loop {}
}
```

You'll need to import the `fmt::Write` trait to use the `write` and `write_str` methods.

## How can we create a println macro for our global writer in Rust?

Now that we have a global writer, we can create a println macro that can be used from anywhere in the codebase. 

Rust's println! macro in the standard library can be used as a model. This macro uses the print! macro to print a formatted string and a newline, and the print! macro calls a function in the io module that actually outputs the text.

Here's how to define these macros for your own codebase:

```rust
// in src/vga_buffer.rs

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => ($crate::vga_buffer::_print(format_args!($($arg)*)));
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! println {
    () => ($crate::print!("\n"));
    ($($arg:tt)*) => ($crate::print!("{}\n", format_args!($($arg)*)));
}

#[doc(hidden)]
pub fn _print(args: fmt::Arguments) {
    use core::fmt::Write;
    WRITER.lock().write_fmt(args).unwrap();
}
```

These macros behave much like the ones in the standard library, but they call your `_print` function, which outputs to the VGA buffer instead of the standard output. The `$crate` prefix ensures that the macros work properly when used from other modules or crates.

The `_print` function takes a `fmt::Arguments` value (which can be created by the `format_args!` macro), locks the `WRITER`, and writes the formatted arguments. All of this is done in a safe way, thanks to the use of a `Mutex` to synchronize access to the `Writer`.

#### (\$(\$arg:tt)\*)
The `$($arg:tt)*` pattern is a common pattern used in macros to capture and repeat arbitrary tokens passed to the macro.

Let's break down the pattern `$($arg:tt)*`:

- `$(` and `)*`: These are the delimiters that enclose the repeated pattern. They indicate that the pattern can match zero or more repetitions of the enclosed tokens.

- `$arg:tt`: This is the pattern for each token tree within the repetition. `$arg` is a placeholder name that represents a single token tree, and `:tt` specifies that it can match any kind of token tree.

Putting it all together, `$($arg:tt)*` allows the macro to capture and repeat any sequence of tokens passed to it.

For example, consider a macro definition:

```rust
macro_rules! my_macro {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {
        // Macro expansion code that uses $arg
    };
}
```

With this macro definition, when you invoke `my_macro` with any number of tokens, like `my_macro!(1 2 3)` or `my_macro!("hello")`, the tokens will be captured by `$($arg:tt)*`. The macro expansion code can then process and manipulate the captured tokens as needed.

Note that `$arg` is just a placeholder name, and you could use any valid identifier name in its place. The `:tt` type constraint specifies that any kind of token tree is allowed, enabling flexibility in handling different types of input tokens within the macro expansion.`

##### What does the $ sign represent?
In Rust macros, the dollar sign ($) is used as a special character to introduce and distinguish macro-specific syntax and constructs. It is part of the Rust macro system's syntax and serves as a marker for macro-specific patterns and variables.

In the context of the pattern `$($arg:tt)*`, the dollar sign is used to indicate the start of a macro-specific pattern. It is followed by the opening parenthesis `(` to define the beginning of the repetition. The repetition itself is denoted by the `$arg:tt` pattern, which captures individual token trees. Finally, the `)*` closing parenthesis marks the end of the repetition.

By using the dollar sign as a prefix in patterns like `$($arg:tt)*`, Rust macros can recognize and handle these special constructs during the macro expansion phase. The dollar sign signals to the Rust compiler that the following pattern or variable is specific to the macro definition and should be interpreted accordingly.

It's worth noting that the use of the dollar sign in macros is a convention and design choice in the Rust language. It helps differentiate macros from regular Rust code and provides a consistent and recognizable syntax for macro-specific constructs.

### Why use "format_args"
In the code snippet `format_args!($($arg)*)`, the `format_args!` macro is used to construct a `std::fmt::Arguments` object that represents the formatted string and its arguments. This object can be passed to various formatting functions or macros to perform the actual printing or processing of the formatted output.

. `format_args!` is the Rust built-in macro provided by the standard library. It constructs a `std::fmt::Arguments` object based on the provided format string and arguments.

By using `format_args!`, you can construct the `std::fmt::Arguments` object without immediately formatting or printing the result. This allows you to pass the `Arguments` object to other functions or macros that accept it, providing flexibility for further processing or printing.

In the case of `_print(format_args!($($arg)*))`, the `format_args!($($arg)*)` construct creates a `std::fmt::Arguments` object based on the provided arguments. This `Arguments` object is then passed to the `_print` function (or macro) for further handling.

The `_print` function or macro implementation can decide how to utilize the `Arguments` object. It might perform actions such as printing the formatted output to the console, writing it to a file, or processing it in any other desired way.

Overall, by using `format_args!($($arg)*)`, you can construct a `std::fmt::Arguments` object representing the formatted string and its arguments, which can then be passed to other functions or macros for further processing or printing.

## How to Print "Hello World" using the `println` Macro in Rust?

To print "Hello World" using the `println` macro in Rust, you can modify the `_start` function in your `main.rs` file like this:

```rust
// in src/main.rs

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() {
    println!("Hello World{}", "!");

    loop {}
}
```

The `#[no_mangle]` attribute is used to tell the Rust compiler not to alter the function’s name during compilation, and the `pub extern "C"` part defines the function as callable from C code. The `println!` macro is used to print to the VGA buffer, and the `loop {}` creates an infinite loop to prevent the `_start` function from returning, which would cause undefined behavior.

When you run this, you should see "Hello World!" printed to your screen:

```
QEMU printing “Hello World!”
```

Note that you don't need to import the `println!` macro in the `_start` function because it's defined in the root namespace.

## How to Print Panic Messages in Rust?

Now that we have a `println!` macro, we can use it in our panic function to print the panic message and the location of the panic. The `panic_handler` attribute defines the function that should be called when a panic occurs. 

```rust
// in main.rs

/// This function is called on panic.
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    println!("{}", info);
    loop {}
}
```

This `panic` function takes a `&PanicInfo` argument, which contains the panic message and optionally the location where the panic occurred. The `println!` macro is used to print this information. The function then enters an infinite loop with `loop {}` to prevent it from returning, which would cause undefined behavior.

Now, when you insert `panic!("Some panic message");` in our `_start` function, you get the following output:

```
QEMU printing “panicked at ‘Some panic message’, src/main.rs:28:5
```

So now, not only do we know that a panic occurred, but we also have the panic message and the location in the code where it happened, which can be helpful for debugging.
