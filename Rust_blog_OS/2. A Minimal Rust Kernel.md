## What Happens During the Boot Process?

When you turn on a computer, it begins by executing firmware code stored in motherboard ROM (Read-Only Memory). This firmware code conducts a power-on self-test, detects available RAM (Random Access Memory), and initializes the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and hardware. Subsequently, the firmware scans for a bootable disk and starts booting the operating system kernel.

### What Are the Firmware Standards for the Boot Process?

On x86 architectures, two firmware standards are prevalent: the "Basic Input/Output System" (BIOS) and the newer "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface" (UEFI).

- **BIOS:** This is the older and simpler standard, supported on any x86 machine since the 1980s. Although it's outdated, its simplicity and widespread compatibility make it widely used.

- **UEFI:** This is a more modern standard with many more features. However, it's also more complex to set up.

### How Does the BIOS Boot Process Work?

Most x86 systems support BIOS booting, including newer UEFI-based machines that use an emulated BIOS. The wide compatibility of BIOS booting is also its biggest disadvantage because it puts the CPU into a 16-bit compatibility mode called "real mode" to ensure compatibility with older bootloaders.

Here's what happens during the BIOS boot process:

1. **BIOS Initialization:** When you turn on a computer, it loads the BIOS from special flash memory on the motherboard. The BIOS runs self-test and hardware initialization routines.

2. **Bootloader Execution:** The BIOS scans for bootable disks. If it finds one, it transfers control to its bootloader, a 512-byte portion of executable code stored at the beginning of the disk. Most bootloaders are larger than 512 bytes, so they're commonly split into a small first stage (fits into 512 bytes) and a second stage loaded by the first stage.

3. **Kernel Loading:** The bootloader determines the location of the kernel image on the disk and loads it into memory. It also switches the CPU from the 16-bit real mode first to the 32-bit protected mode and then to the 64-bit long mode, where 64-bit registers and the complete main memory are available.

4. **Kernel Initialization:** The bootloader queries certain information (like a memory map) from the BIOS and passes it to the OS kernel.

### What is the Multiboot Standard?

To avoid each operating system implementing its own bootloader, the Free Software Foundation created an open bootloader standard called Multiboot in 1995. This standard defines an interface between the bootloader and the operating system, so any Multiboot-compliant bootloader can load any Multiboot-compliant operating system. The reference implementation is GNU GRUB, which is the most popular bootloader for Linux systems.

However, GRUB and the Multiboot standard have certain limitations:

- They only support the 32-bit protected mode, meaning you still have to do the CPU configuration to switch to the 64-bit long mode.
- They are designed to make the bootloader simple instead of the kernel, leading to potential complications for the kernel.
- Both GRUB and the Multiboot standard are only sparsely documented.
- GRUB needs to be installed on the host system to create a bootable disk image from the kernel file, which complicates development on Windows or Mac.

Despite these drawbacks, Multiboot support is often added to boot image tools, allowing the loading of a kernel on a GRUB system.

## What is Target Specification in Cargo?

Cargo, the Rust package manager, supports different target systems through the `--target` parameter. The target is described by a so-called target triple, which describes the CPU architecture, the vendor, the operating system, and the ABI. For example, the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target triple describes a system with an x86_64 CPU, no specific vendor, a Linux operating system, and the GNU ABI. 

Rust supports many different target triples, including `arm-linux-androideabi` for Android or `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for WebAssembly. In the context of kernel development, a special configuration is required, so none of the existing target triples fits. Therefore, Rust allows us to define our own target through a JSON file.

```json
{
    "llvm-target": "x86_64-unknown-none",
    "data-layout": "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128",
    "arch": "x86_64",
    "target-endian": "little",
    "target-pointer-width": "64",
    "target-c-int-width": "32",
    "os": "none",
    "executables": true,
    "linker-flavor": "ld.lld",
    "linker": "rust-lld",
    "panic-strategy": "abort",
    "disable-redzone": true,
    "features": "-mmx,-sse,+soft-float"
}
```
This target specification file informs Cargo to compile for a system with x86_64 architecture, no specific OS (i.e., running on bare metal), little endian format, a pointer width of 64 bits, and a C integer width of 32 bits.

## What is the Role of the Linker in the Target Specification?

The `linker-flavor` and `linker` fields specify the linker to be used. The linker links the compiled code with the libraries it uses. In this case, the linker specified is `ld.lld` (LLVM linker) which is cross-platform, and it is the one that ships with Rust. This linker can link our kernel even if the platform’s default linker might not support Linux targets.

## What is the Panic Strategy in the Target Specification?

The `panic-strategy` field is set to "abort" to specify that the target doesn’t support stack unwinding on panic. Instead, the program should abort directly. This is crucial because it has the same effect as the `panic = "abort"` option in our `Cargo.toml`.

## What is the Purpose of Disabling the Redzone in the Target Specification?

The `disable-redzone` field is set to true. This is done to safely handle interrupts in the kernel. This particular stack pointer optimization called the "red zone" must be disabled because it would cause stack corruption otherwise.

## What Does the Features Field in the Target Specification Signify?

The `features` field enables/disables target features. In this case, the `mmx` and `sse` features, which determine support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions, are disabled. 

SIMD instructions can speed up programs significantly. However, using the large SIMD registers in OS kernels leads to performance problems due to the need to restore all registers to their original state before continuing an interrupted program. 

The kernel has to save the complete SIMD state to main memory on each system call or hardware interrupt. Since the SIMD state is large and interrupts can occur often, these additional save/restore operations can significantly harm performance. To avoid this, SIMD for the kernel is disabled (but not for applications running on top).

The `soft-float` feature is enabled to handle floating point operations on x86_64 that require SIMD registers by default. The `soft-float` feature emulates all floating point operations through software functions based on normal integers.

## How to Compile for a Custom Target Specification in Rust?

To compile code for the custom target, you need to pass the name of the JSON file containing your target specification to the `--target` parameter of the `cargo build` command:

```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-blog_os.json
```

However, this command will fail because the Rust compiler no longer finds the `core` library. This library contains basic Rust types such as `Result`, `Option`, and iterators, and is implicitly linked to all `no_std` crates. 

The problem is that the `core` library is distributed together with the Rust compiler as a precompiled library, which is only valid for supported host triples but not for a custom target. 

## How to Overcome the Problem of Missing `core` Crate for Custom Target?

To solve the issue with the missing `core` crate, you can use the `build-std` feature of Cargo. This feature allows recompiling `core` and other standard library crates on demand, instead of using the precompiled versions shipped with the Rust installation. 

To use this feature, create a `cargo` configuration file at `.cargo/config.toml` with the following content:

```toml
# in .cargo/config.toml

[unstable]
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins"]
```

In this configuration, you tell `cargo` that it should recompile the `core` and `compiler_builtins` libraries. The latter is required because it is a dependency of `core`. In order to recompile these libraries, `cargo` needs access to the rust source code, which can be installed with `rustup component add rust-src`.

After setting the `unstable.build-std` configuration key and installing the `rust-src` component, you can rerun the build command.

## What are Memory-Related Intrinsics in Rust?

In Rust, the compiler assumes that a certain set of built-in functions is available for all systems. Most of these functions are provided by the `compiler_builtins` crate. However, some memory-related functions are not enabled by default as they are normally provided by the system's C library. These functions include:

- `memset`: This function sets all bytes in a memory block to a given value.
- `memcpy`: This function copies one memory block to another.
- `memcmp`: This function compares two memory blocks.

While these functions may not be needed to compile a basic kernel, they become necessary as the code becomes more complex. For instance, when copying structs around, these functions are required.

## How can we Provide Memory-Related Functions without Linking to a C Library?

Since we can’t link to the C library of the operating system when developing a bare-metal application such as an OS kernel, we need an alternative way to provide these functions to the compiler.

Implementing these functions manually by applying the `#[no_mangle]` attribute (which prevents Rust from automatically renaming them during compilation) is one possible approach. However, this can be dangerous since the slightest mistake in the implementation of these functions could lead to undefined behavior.

For example, implementing `memcpy` with a for loop may result in infinite recursion because for loops implicitly call the `IntoIterator::into_iter` trait method, which may call `memcpy` again. 

To avoid such issues, it is recommended to reuse existing, well-tested implementations.

## Can we Reuse Existing Implementations of Memory-Related Functions?

Yes, we can reuse existing implementations. Fortunately, the `compiler_builtins` crate already contains implementations for all the needed functions. They are just disabled by default to avoid collision with the implementations from the C library.

We can enable them by setting cargo’s `build-std-features` flag to `["compiler-builtins-mem"]`. Like the `build-std` flag, this flag can be configured in the `unstable` table in the `.cargo/config.toml` file:

```toml
# in .cargo/config.toml

[unstable]
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins"]
```

This flag enables the `mem` feature of the `compiler_builtins` crate. The effect is that the `#[no_mangle]` attribute is applied to the `memcpy` etc. implementations of the crate, which makes them available to the linker. 

Please note, support for the `compiler-builtins-mem` feature was only added recently, so you need at least Rust nightly 2020-09-30 for it.

## How to Set a Default Target in Cargo?

To avoid passing the `--target` parameter on every invocation of `cargo build`, we can override the default target by adding the following to our cargo configuration file at `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
# in .cargo/config.toml

[build]
target = "x86_64-blog_os.json"
```

This tells cargo to use our `x86_64-blog_os.json` target when no explicit `--target` argument is passed. This means that we can now build our kernel with a simple `cargo build`. 

## How to Print Text to the Screen at This Stage?

The easiest way to print text to the screen at this stage is the VGA text buffer. It is a special memory area mapped to the VGA hardware that contains the contents displayed on screen. It normally consists of 25 lines that each contain 80 character cells. Each character cell displays an ASCII character with some foreground and background colors.

To print "Hello World!", the buffer is located at address 0xb8000 and each character cell consists of an ASCII byte and a color byte. 

The implementation looks like this:

```rust
static HELLO: &[u8] = b"Hello World!";

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    let vga_buffer = 0xb8000 as *mut u8;

    for (i, &byte) in HELLO.iter().enumerate() {
        unsafe {
            *vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2) = byte;
            *vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2 + 1) = 0xb;
        }
    }

    loop {}
}
```

### How might this look in memory?
This code is writing the string "Hello World!" to VGA text mode memory, which starts at the physical address `0xb8000`.

The VGA text mode memory is structured in such a way that each character cell is composed of two bytes. The first byte is the ASCII code of the character to display, and the second byte determines the color of the character. This is why in the loop the code is writing to `vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2)` for the character and `vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2 + 1)` for the color. The color value `0xb` corresponds to bright cyan in VGA color codes.

After running this code, the VGA text buffer memory would look like this:

```
Address |  Value (ASCII) |  Color
--------|----------------|--------
0xb8000 |     'H'        |  0xb
0xb8002 |     'e'        |  0xb
0xb8004 |     'l'        |  0xb
0xb8006 |     'l'        |  0xb
0xb8008 |     'o'        |  0xb
0xb800a |     ' '        |  0xb
0xb800c |     'W'        |  0xb
0xb800e |     'o'        |  0xb
0xb8010 |     'r'        |  0xb
0xb8012 |     'l'        |  0xb
0xb8014 |     'd'        |  0xb
0xb8016 |     '!'        |  0xb
```

This means the string "Hello World!" would be displayed on the screen in bright cyan color. Note that all other memory locations in the VGA text mode memory not touched by this code will remain as they were. 

This approach is often seen in bare metal programming, especially when dealing with a simple bootloader or OS kernel that wants to print text to the screen without relying on any high-level operating system services, because it can directly access and manipulate hardware memory. 

Finally, remember that this operation is highly unsafe from Rust's safety guarantees perspective, and is only used in specific systems programming contexts.

### Why static?
In the given code, the line "static HELLO: &[u8] = b"Hello World!";" declares a static variable named `HELLO` with a type of `&[u8]` (a reference to a byte slice).

The purpose of this line is to define a static byte slice containing the ASCII representation of the string "Hello World!". The `b"Hello World!"` syntax is used to create a byte string literal in Rust.

By using the `static` keyword, the variable `HELLO` is allocated statically and has a `'static` lifetime, meaning it exists for the entire duration of the program. It is stored in a read-only memory section and can be accessed globally from anywhere in the program.

The `&[u8]` type represents a slice reference to a sequence of bytes. In this case, it refers to the byte slice containing the ASCII representation of the string. This allows the code to iterate over the bytes of the string using the `iter()` method.

The code then uses a loop to iterate over each byte in the `HELLO` byte slice and write it to the VGA buffer, which is a memory-mapped display buffer used for text output in certain computer systems.

Overall, this line of code initializes a static byte slice variable `HELLO` with the value "Hello World!" and sets up the initial display of this string in the VGA buffer.

In the given code snippet, the line:

```rust
let vga_buffer = 0xb8000 as *mut u8;
```

declares a mutable raw pointer `vga_buffer` and assigns it the memory address `0xb8000`. The pointer is cast to the type `*mut u8`, which represents a mutable raw pointer to an unsigned 8-bit integer.

Here's what this line does:

1. `0xb8000`: This is a memory address that represents the start of the VGA text buffer. In VGA text mode, the video memory is typically located at this address, and it holds the display data for the text-based graphics.

2. `as *mut u8`: The `as` keyword is used for type casting in Rust. It allows you to convert one type to another. In this case, the memory address `0xb8000` is cast to the type `*mut u8`, which is a mutable raw pointer to an unsigned 8-bit integer. This type indicates that the pointer points to a memory location that can store bytes.

By declaring and initializing `vga_buffer` as a mutable raw pointer to `u8` at the memory address `0xb8000`, it allows direct access to the VGA text buffer. This enables the code to manipulate the content of the VGA text buffer and control what is displayed on the screen in VGA text mode.

It's important to note that raw pointers in Rust are considered unsafe, as they bypass many of Rust's safety guarantees. Manipulating raw pointers can lead to undefined behavior and memory safety issues if not handled properly. The code snippet uses `unsafe` blocks when dereferencing and manipulating the raw pointer to explicitly indicate that it contains potentially unsafe operations.
 - - - 
Here's what the unsafe lines do:

1. `*vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2) = byte;`: This line writes the ASCII character `byte` to the VGA text buffer at the specified offset. The `vga_buffer` is a pointer to the VGA text buffer in memory (0xB8000), and `offset(i as isize * 2)` calculates the memory offset based on the index `i` multiplied by 2. The multiplication by 2 is because each character cell in the VGA text buffer consists of two bytes: one for the ASCII character and one for the text attributes.

	The first byte within the character cell represents the ASCII character itself. It holds the value of the character to be displayed, such as 'A', '!', or '3'. The ASCII values range from 0 to 255, corresponding to different characters.

	The second byte within the character cell represents the text attributes for that particular character cell. Text attributes specify additional information about the display properties of the character, such as the foreground and background colors.
    
2. `*vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2 + 1) = 0xb;`: This line sets the text attribute of the corresponding character cell in the VGA text buffer. The `offset(i as isize * 2 + 1)` calculates the memory offset for the text attributes of the character cell. The value `0xb` represents the text attribute, specifying the foreground and background colors for the character. In this case, `0xb` corresponds to light cyan text on a black background.
    
Together, these lines iterate over the bytes in the `HELLO` string and write each character and its associated attribute to the VGA text buffer, effectively displaying "Hello World!" on the screen when running in VGA text mode.

## Why Use Unsafe Blocks in Rust?

There's an unsafe block around all memory writes because the Rust compiler can't prove that the raw pointers we create are valid. They could point anywhere and lead to data corruption. By putting them into an unsafe block, we're basically telling the compiler that we are absolutely sure that the operations are valid. 

However, this is not the best practice. It's very easy to mess up when working with raw pointers inside unsafe blocks. For example, we could easily write beyond the buffer’s end if we’re not careful.

Rust allows us to minimize the use of `unsafe` by creating safe abstractions. We could create a VGA buffer type that encapsulates all unsafety and ensures that it is impossible to do anything wrong from the outside. This way, we only need minimal amounts of `unsafe` code and can ensure that we don’t violate memory safety.
